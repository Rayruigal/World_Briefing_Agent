        "text": "In this photo released by the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, center, heads to the venue for talks between Iran and the U.S., in Muscat, Oman, Friday, Feb. 6, 2026. (Iranian Foreign Ministry via AP, File)2026-02-14T19:32:18Z\n                                        GENEVA (AP) — Iran and the United States will hold a second round of talks over Tehran’s nuclear program next week, the Swiss Foreign Ministry said Saturday. Oman, which welcomed the first round of indirect talks on Feb. 6, will host the talks in Geneva, the Swiss ministry said, without specifying which days. After the first discussions, U.S. President Donald Trump warned Tehran that failure to reach an agreement with his administration would be “very traumatic.”Similar talks last year broke down in June as Israel launched what became a 12-day war on Iran that included the U.S. bombing Iranian nuclear sites.Trump has repeatedly threatened to use force to compel Iran to agree to constrain its nuclear program. Iran has said it would respond with an attack of its own. Trump also has threatened Iran over its deadly crackdown on recent nationwide protests there.\n    \n        \n    \n\nGulf Arab nations have warned any attack could spiral into another regional conflict.Trump said Friday the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, was being sent from the Caribbean to the Mideast to join other military assets the U.S. has built up in the region. He also said a change in power in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen.”\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe indirect talks on Feb. 6 were between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff. The top military commander in the Middle East was also present for the first time.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe Trump administration has maintained that Iran can have no uranium enrichment under any deal. Tehran says it won’t agree to that.Iran has insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. However, its officials increasingly threaten to pursue a nuclear weapon. Before the June war, Iran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has said his nation is “ready for any kind of verification.” However, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has been unable for months to inspect and verify Iran’s nuclear stockpile.\n    \n        \n    \n\nTrump has suggested in recent weeks that his top priority is for Iran to scale back its nuclear program. Iran has said it wants talks to focus solely on the nuclear program.But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who met with Trump in Washington this week, has pressed for any deal to include steps to neutralize Iran’s ballistic missile program and end its funding for proxy groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah.",

        "title": "European nations say Alexei Navalny was poisoned by the Kremlin with dart frog toxin",
        "text": "Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny speaks to the media in front of security officers standing guard at the Foundation for Fighting Corruption office in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Dec. 26, 2019. (AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko, File)2026-02-14T13:00:28Z\n                                        LONDON (AP) — Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned by the Kremlin with a rare and lethal toxin found in the skin of poison dart frogs, five European countries said Saturday.The foreign ministries of the U.K., France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said analysis of samples taken from Navalny’s body “conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine.” It is a neurotoxin found in the skin of dart frogs in South America that is not found naturally in Russia, they said.The countries said in a joint statement that “Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison.” They said they were reporting Russia to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention.They made the announcement as Navalny’s widow Yulia Navalnaya attended the Munich Security Conference in Germany as the second anniversary of Navalny’s death approaches.\n    \n        \n    \n\nNavalny, who crusaded against official corruption and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests as President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest foe, died in an Arctic penal colony on Feb. 16, 2024. He was serving a 19-year sentence that he believed to be politically motivated.\n\n“Russia saw Navalny as a threat,” British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said. “By using this form of poison the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition.”\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nNavalny’s widow, said last year that two independent labs had found that her husband was poisoned shortly before he died. Navalnaya has repeatedly blamed Putin for Navalny’s death, something Russian officials have vehemently denied.Navalnaya said Saturday that she had been “certain from the first day” that her husband had been poisoned, “but now there is proof.”“Putin killed Alexei with chemical weapon,” she wrote on social network X, calling Putin “a murderer” who “must be held accountable.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nRussian authorities said that the politician became ill after a walk and died from natural causes.Epibatidine is found naturally in dart frogs in the wild, and can also be manufactured in a lab, which European scientists suspect was the case with the substance used on Navalny. It works on the body in a similar way to nerve agents, causing shortness of breath, convulsions, seizures, a slowed heart rate and ultimately death.Navalny was the target of an earlier poisoning in 2020, with a nerve agent in an attack he blamed on the Kremlin, which always denied involvement. His family and allies fought to have him flown to Germany for treatment and recovery. Five months later, he returned to Russia, where he was immediately arrested and imprisoned for the last three years of his life.The U.K. has accused Russia of repeatedly flouting international bans on chemical and biological weapons. It has accused the Kremlin of carrying out a 2018 attack in the English city of Salisbury that targeted a former Russian intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, with the nerve agent Novichok. A British inquiry concluded that the attack “must have been authorized at the highest level, by President Putin.”The Kremlin has denied involvement.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JILL LAWLESS\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Lawless is based in London, covering British politics, diplomacy and culture and top stories from the UK and beyond.

        "text": "Construction continues on the ballroom where the East Wing used to stand at the White House, Friday, Feb. 13, 2026, in Washington. (AP Photo/Tom Brenner)2026-02-13T23:53:50Z\n                                        The White House mansion’s eastern facade appears to have been “excellently preserved” when demolition crews tore down the East Wing to make way for President Donald Trump’s planned ballroom, an administration official said in a memo made public Friday. Contractors took pains to protect the White House residence during demolition, keeping heavy equipment at a safe distance and removing some pieces by hand, Joshua Fisher, director of the White House Office of Administration, wrote to the commission charged with approving plans for Trump’s ballroom. Some sections of the building were stabilized ahead of time, and vibration and crack movement were monitored, he wrote. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n\nYour browser does not support the iframe HTML tag.

The agency has jurisdiction over construction and major renovations to government buildings in the region.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe East Wing demolition prompted a public outcry when it began without the independent reviews, congressional approval and public comment that are typical for even relatively minor modifications to historic buildings in Washington. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued to halt construction of the ballroom.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe memo documents the history of the East Wing dating back to Thomas Jefferson’s presidency and lays out the White House’s justification for tearing it down, saying it was not feasible to preserve it while meeting Trump’s goals for the project. The completed ballroom will include an improved visitors center for security screening and will lessen the need for road closures during major events, Fisher wrote. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nCurators documented and preserved artwork, furniture and other items of historical significance, including “the East Wing cornerstone and plaque, movie theater furniture, the East Colonnade columns, the Porte-cochere columns, interior wood paneling, chandeliers, historic windows and doors, and other hardware and fixtures,” he wrote. \n    \n        \n    \n\n“Our goal is to ensure that some of these items will be integrated into the new structure,” Fisher added.Engineers are studying whether the West Colonnade, which connects the White House residence to the West Wing offices, can support a second story that would make it more visually symmetrical with plans for a larger East Colonnade connecting to the ballroom, the memo said. No decisions have been made. The White House also submitted the most detailed renderings of the ballroom published to date. It shows a massive new building that dwarfs the size of the demolished East Wing and matches the height of the historic White House mansion. The project is scheduled for discussion during a March 5 meeting of the National Capital Planning Commission. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JONATHAN J.

        "text": "Bodies of unidentified Palestinians returned from Israel as part of the ceasefire deal are buried in Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, Friday, Feb. 13, 2026. (AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)2026-02-14T13:28:36Z\n                                        TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Doctors Without Borders has announced the suspension of some operations at one of Gaza ‘s largest functioning hospitals after patients and staff reported seeing armed, masked men roaming parts of the building.Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis is one of the territory’s few functioning hospitals. Hundreds of patients and war-wounded have been treated there daily, and it was a hub for Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in exchange for Israeli hostages as part of the current ceasefire deal.The comments by the aid group, which is also known by its acronym MSF, are a rare announcement by an international organization about the presence of armed men in or near medical facilities in Gaza since the war began over two years ago.MSF said in a statement all its noncritical medical operations at Nasser Hospital were suspended due to security breaches that posed “serious security threats to our teams and patients.”\n    \n        \n    \n\n“MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable acts including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons,” it said.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nWhile the suspension occurred in January, it was first disclosed in MSF’s “frequently asked questions” section on its website. It’s unclear when the post was made, but the site said it was updated Feb. 11.MSF said it made the difficult decision after an increase of patients and staff seeing armed men in parts of the hospital compound since the U.S.-brokered October ceasefire was reached. The gunmen were seen in areas where the group didn’t operate.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nAttacks on health facilitiesMSF said it wasn’t able to indicate the armed men’s affiliation. It said it had expressed concern to the “relevant” authorities, without elaborating, stressing that hospitals must remain neutral, civilian spaces. It said its concerns were heightened by previous, deliberate Israeli attacks on health facilities.Throughout the war, which began with the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel has repeatedly struck hospitals, including Nasser, accusing the militant group of operating in or around them. Hamas security men often have been seen inside hospitals, blocking access to some areas.Some hostages released from Gaza have said they spent time during captivity in a hospital.\n    \n        \n    \n\nWhile Hamas remains the dominant force in areas not under Israeli control, including Nasser Hospital, other armed groups have mushroomed across Gaza as a result of the war, including groups backed by Israel’s army in the Israeli-controlled part of the strip.Nasser Hospital staff say that in recent months it has been repeatedly attacked by masked, armed men and militias, despite police presence there.Police to be deployedThe Hamas-run interior ministry, which oversees police in Gaza, said officers would be deployed to secure hospitals and rid them of armed presence. It said it would take legal action against violators and was implementing stricter measures to ensure patients’ safety.While international law gives hospitals special protections during war, they can lose this immunity if combatants use them to hide fighters or store weapons, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Still, there must be plenty of warning to allow the evacuation of staff and patients before any operations take place. If harm to civilians from an attack is disproportionate to the military objective, it is illegal under international law.\n    \n        \n    \n\nAid groups and rights organizations say Israel has decimated Gaza’s health system, forcing most of its hospitals to shut down while heavily damaging others. During the war, Israeli forces raided a number of hospitals, detaining hundreds of staff.Israel also has targeted the police in Gaza.\n    \n        \n    \n\nA weakened medical systemMSF said it will continue supporting critical services at Nasser Hospital, including inpatient and surgical departments for patients with traumatic or burn injuries. However, it is ending support to the pediatrics and maternity wards, including the neonatal intensive care unit. It has also indefinitely suspended its outpatient consultations for 3D burn screening and mental health, as well as other services.Zaher al-Waheidi, head of the records department at Gaza’s health ministry, said MSF’s suspension would have a significant impact as hundreds of patients are admitted to the maternity and burn wards daily. He said the ministry would take over maternity patient care, but said burn victims won’t have many options.Israel has been cracking down on aid groups operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including MSF. The group is one of more than three dozen that Israel has banned from operating in the strip for failing to comply with new registration rules.MSF says Israel’s decision will have a catastrophic impact on its work in Gaza, where it provides funding and international staff for six hospitals and operates two field hospitals and eight primary health centers, clinics and medical points. It also runs two of Gaza’s five stabilization centers, helping children with severe malnutrition.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe toll of warWhile the heaviest fighting has subsided, the fragile ceasefire has been seen almost daily Israeli fire. Israeli forces have carried out repeated airstrikes and frequently fire on Palestinians near military-held zones, killing 591 Palestinians since the ceasefire took effect, according to Gaza health officials.The ministry said the overall Palestinian death toll from the war is at least 72,051.The ministry, part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. It does not give a breakdown of civilians and militants. Militants have carried out shooting attacks on troops, and Israel says its strikes are in response to that and other violations. Four Israeli soldiers have been killed.___Magdy reported from Cairo.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                SAM MEDNICK\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Mednick is an AP correspondent for Israel and the Palestinian Territories.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, Pool)2026-02-14T08:26:14Z\n                                        KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Russian drone strike on the Ukrainian city of Odesa killed one person, officials said Saturday, ahead of fresh talks next week aimed at ending the war.The drone hit a residential building in the Black Sea port city, leaving an older woman dead, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said Saturday.On Friday, a Ukrainian missile strike killed two people and wounded five in the Russian border city of Belgorod, according to regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov.Meanwhile, another round of U.S.-brokered talks between envoys from Russia and Ukraine will take place next week in Geneva, days ahead of the fourth anniversary of the all-out Russian invasion of its neighbor, officials in Moscow and Kyiv said on Friday.The discussions will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies.\n    \n        \n    \n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s communications adviser, Dmytro Lytvyn, confirmed the new round of negotiations.The talks take place against a backdrop of continued fighting along the roughly 1,250-kilometer (750-mile) front line, relentless Russian bombardment of civilian areas of Ukraine and the country’s power grid, and Kyiv’s almost daily long-range drone attacks on war-related assets on Russian soil.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nPrevious U.S.-led efforts to find consensus on ending the war, most recently two rounds of talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, have failed to resolve difficult issues, such as the future of Ukraine’s Donbas industrial heartland that is largely occupied by Russian forces. Zelenskyy said last week that the United States has given Ukraine and Russia a June deadline to reach a deal. Previous deadlines given by U.S. President Donald Trump have passed largely without consequence.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n                    \n    获取更多RSS：https://feedx.net https://feedx.site",

        "text": "Supports of Iran&#x27;s exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi attend a demonstration during the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany, Saturday, Feb. 14, 2026. (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi)2026-02-14T10:46:51Z\n                                        MUNICH, Germany (AP) — Supporters of Iran ’s exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi were looking Saturday to world leaders gathered in Munich, Germany, to ratchet up pressure for change on the Iranian government.Pahlavi called for demonstrations in Munich, Los Angeles and Toronto on what he described as a “global day of action,” urging supporters to take to streets to push for “urgent, practical steps in support of the Iranian people.”Iranian leaders are already under intense scrutiny, facing renewed threats of U.S. military action from President Donald Trump. Trump wants Iran to further scale back its nuclear program. He suggested Friday that regime change in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen.” Iran was also the focus of protests in Munich on Friday, the opening day of an annual security conference in the city gathering European leaders and global security figures. Supporters of the Iranian opposition group People’s Mujahedeen Organization of Iran, also known as the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, demonstrated against Iran’s deadly crackdown on nationwide protests last month.\n    \n        \n    \n\nPahlavi, the son of Iran’s deposed shah who abandoned his throne and fled the country in 1979, has been in exile for nearly 50 years but is trying to position himself as a player in Iran’s future.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nAt a news conference in Munich on Saturday, Pahlavi warned of the likelihood of more deaths in Iran if “democracies stand by and watch.” \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“We gather at an hour of profound peril to ask: Will the world stand with the people of Iran?” he asked.He added that the Iranian government’s continued survival “sends a clear signal to every bully: kill enough people and you stay in power.” The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says at least 7,005 people were killed in the protest, including 214 government forces. It has been accurate in counting deaths during previous rounds of unrest in Iran and relies on a network of activists in Iran to verify deaths. \n    \n        \n    \n\nIran’s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. Iran’s theocracy in the past has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll, given authorities have disrupted internet access and international calls in Iran.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n                    \n    获取更多RSS：https://feedx.net https://feedx.site",

        "title": "TSA agents are working without pay at US airports due to another shutdown",
        "text": "Travelers wait at a TSA security checkpoint at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, Nov. 30, 2025, in Romulus, Mich. (AP Photo/Ryan Sun, File)2026-02-14T05:05:37Z\n                                        A shutdown of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that took effect early Saturday impacts the agency responsible for screening passengers and bags at airports across the country. Travelers with airline reservations may be nervously recalling a 43-day government shutdown that led to historic flight cancellations and long delays last year. Transportation Security Administration officers are expected to work without pay while lawmakers remain without an agreement on Homeland Security’s annual funding. TSA officers also worked through the record shutdown that ended Nov. 12, but aviation experts say this one may play out differently. Trade groups for the U.S. travel industry and major airlines nonetheless warned that the longer DHS appropriations are lapsed, the longer security lines at the nation’s commercial airports could get. Here’s what to know about the latest shutdown and how to plan ahead.\n    \n        \n    \n\nWhat’s different about this shutdown?Funding for Homeland Security expired at midnight. But the rest of the federal government is funded through Sept. 30. That means air traffic controllers employed by the Federal Aviation Administration will receive paychecks as usual, reducing the risk of widespread flight cancellations. According to the department’s contingency plan, about 95% of TSA workers are deemed essential personnel and required to keep working. Democrats in the House and Senate say Homeland Security won’t get funded until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations.During past shutdowns, disruptions to air travel tended to build over time, not overnight. About a month into last year’s shutdown, for example, TSA temporarily closed two checkpoints at Philadelphia International Airport. That same day, the government took the extraordinary step of ordering all commercial airlines to reduce their domestic flight schedules.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nJohn Rose, chief risk officer for global travel management company Altour, said strains could surface at airports more quickly this time because the TSA workforce also will be remembering the last shutdown.“It’s still fresh in their minds and potentially their pocketbooks,” Rose said.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nWhat is the impact on travelers?It’s hard to predict whether, when or where security screening snags might pop up. Even a handful of unscheduled TSA absences could quickly lead to longer wait times at smaller airports, for example, if there’s just a single security checkpoint.That’s why travelers should plan to arrive early and allow extra time to get through security.“I tell people to do this even in good times,” Rose said.Experts say flight delays also are a possibility even though air traffic controllers are not affected by the DHS shutdown.Airlines might decide to delay departures in some cases to wait for passengers to clear screening, said Rich Davis, senior security advisor at risk mitigation company International SOS. Shortages of TSA officers also could slow the screening of checked luggage behind the scenes. \n    \n        \n    \n\nWhat travelers can do to prepareMost airports display security line wait times on their websites, but don’t wait until the day of a flight to check them, Rose advised.“You may look online and it says two-and-a-half hours,” he said. “Now it’s two-and-a-half hours before your flight and you haven’t left for the airport yet.”Passengers should also pay close attention while packing since prohibited items are likely to prolong the screening process. For carry-on bags, avoid bringing full-size shampoo or other liquids, large gels or aerosols and items like pocketknives in carry-on bags.\n    \n        \n    \n\nTSA has a full list on its website of what is and isn’t allowed in carry-on and checked luggage.At the airport, Rose said, remember to “practice patience and empathy.”“Not only are they not getting paid,” he said of TSA agents, “they’re probably working with reduced staff and dealing with angry travelers.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nWill the shutdown drag on?The White House has been negotiating with Democratic lawmakers, but the two sides failed to reach a deal by the end of the week before senators and members of Congress were set to leave Washington for a 10-day break.Lawmakers in both chambers were on notice, however, to return if a deal to end the shutdown is struck.Democrats have said they won’t help approve more funding for Homeland Security until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis last month.In a joint statement, U.S. Travel, Airlines for America and the American Hotel &amp; Lodging Association warned that the shutdown threatens to disrupt air travel as the busy spring break travel season approaches.“Travelers and the U.S. economy cannot afford to have essential TSA personnel working without pay, which increases the risk of unscheduled absences and call outs, and ultimately can lead to higher wait times and missed or delayed flights,” the statement said.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                RIO YAMAT\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Yamat is a national business reporter for The Associated Press.

        "text": "From left to right, Leader of the Official Opposition of Canada Pierre Poilievre, Prime Minister Mark Carney and Governor General of Canada, Mary Simon join hands while attending a vigil for the victims of a mass shooting, in Tumbler Ridge, B.C., Friday, Feb. 13, 2026. (Christinne Muschi/The Canadian Press via AP)2026-02-14T02:58:44Z\n                                        VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and the country’s main opposition leader held hands Friday as they paid tribute to the victims of one of the worst mass shootings in the country’s history at a vigil in a devastated British Columbia town. Carney and Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre joined hands as an Indigenous leader sang a prayer outside the town hall in Tumbler Ridge. Carney and Poilievre also spoke. The prime minister named each of the six people killed at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and said the mother and brother of the shooter who were killed also “deserve to be mourned.” Authorities said the 18-year-old alleged shooter, identified as Jesse Van Rootselaar, killed her 39-year-old mother, Jennifer Jacobs, and 11-year-old stepbrother, Emmett Jacobs, in their home on Tuesday before heading to the nearby Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and opening fire, killing five children and an educator before killing herself.\n    \n        \n    \n\nCarney said he sat with people who are “living through something no one should ever have to endure.”“When you wake up tomorrow, and the world feels impossible, know that millions of Canadians are with you. When the cameras leave and the quiet sets in — know that we will still be here,” Carney said. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nA crowd of hundreds attended the vigil. Some held photos of loved ones they lost.Carney said the community has always been defined by people caring for each other.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“And when the unimaginable happened on Tuesday, you were there again. First responders at the school within two minutes. Teachers shielding their children,” he said.Poilievre commended Carney for his “tremendous grace.” Canada’s political leaders flew from Ottawa together. British Columbia Premier David Eby said the students of the school won’t ever have to return to the building if they don’t want to. “I will promise that not one of you will ever be forced to go back to that school. We will provide a safe place for you to go back to school,” Eby said. \n    \n        \n    \n\nAuthorities on Thursday identified those killed at the school as Kylie Smith, Abel Mwansa, Zoey Benoit and Ticaria Lampert, all age 12, as well as 13-year-old Ezekiel Schofield and assistant teacher Shannda Aviugana-Durand, 39.Maya Gebala, 12, who was wounded in the head and neck, and Paige Hoekstra, 19, who also suffered bullet wounds, remain hospitalized in Vancouver.Dwayne McDonald, the deputy commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia, said earlier Friday that the alleged shooter did not appear to be searching for a specific target at the school.“This suspect was, for lack of a better term, hunting,” McDonald said. “They were prepared and engaging anybody and everybody they could come in contact with.”McDonald described a “chaotic” scene at the school when police arrived, with fire alarms sounding and a person yelling out a window that the suspect was upstairs.“They entered the school, proceeded to go up the stairwell, and were met with gunfire,” he said. “It was a matter of seconds after that there was more gunfire, not as we know now, having reviewed video, directed at any persons. Then the suspect took their life.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nMcDonald said from the time the suspect encountered police there were no further injuries to students at the school.Four guns were seized, two from the family home and two from the school, he said.The attack was Canada’s deadliest since 2020, when a gunman in Nova Scotia killed 13 people and set fires that left another nine dead.School shootings are rare in Canada, which has strict gun-control laws. The government has responded to previous mass shootings with gun-control measures, including a recently broadened ban on all guns it considers assault weapons.___Gillies reported from Toronto.",

(NASA via AP)2026-02-14T20:16:52Z\n                                        CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The International Space Station returned to full strength with Saturday’s arrival of four new astronauts to replace colleagues who bailed early because of health concerns.SpaceX delivered the U.S., French and Russian astronauts a day after launching them from Cape Canaveral.Last month’s medical evacuation was NASA’s first in 65 years of human spaceflight. One of four astronauts launched by SpaceX last summer suffered what officials described as a serious health issue, prompting their hasty return. That left only three crew members to keep the place running — one American and two Russians — prompting NASA to pause spacewalks and trim research.Moving in for eight to nine months are NASA’s Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, France’s Sophie Adenot and Russia’s Andrei Fedyaev. Meir, a marine biologist, and Fedyaev, a former military pilot, have lived up there before. During her first station visit in 2019, Meir took part in the first all-female spacewalk.\n    \n        \n    \n\nAdenot, a military helicopter pilot, is only the second French woman to fly in space. Hathaway is a captain in the U.S. Navy.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n“Bonjour!” Adenot called out once the capsule docked to the space station 277 miles (446 kilometers) up. Added Meir: “Grateful to be on board, and we’re ready to get to work.”NASA has refused to divulge the identity of the astronaut who fell ill in orbit on Jan. 7 or explain what happened, citing medical privacy. The ailing astronaut and three others returned to Earth more than a month sooner than planned. They spent their first night back on Earth at the hospital before returning to Houston.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe space agency said it did not alter its preflight medical checks for their replacements.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

        "title": "Sub-$200 Lidar Could Reshuffle  Auto Sensor Economics",
        "text": "MicroVision, a solid-state sensor technology company located in Redmond, Wash., says it has designed a solid-state automotive lidar sensor intended to reach production pricing below US $200. That’s less than half of typical prices now, and it’s not even the full extent of the company’s ambition. The company says its longer-term goal is $100 per unit. MicroVision’s claim, which, if realized, would place lidar within reach of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) rather than limiting it to high-end autonomous vehicle programs. Lidar’s limited market penetration comes down to one issue: cost.Comparable mechanical lidars from multiple suppliers now sell in the $10,000 to $20,000 range. That price roughly tenfold drop, from about $80,000, helps explain why suppliers now are now hopeful that another steep price reduction is on the horizon.For solid-state devices, “it is feasible to bring the cost down even more when manufacturing at high volume,” says Hayder Radha, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Michigan State University and director of the school’s Connected & Autonomous Networked Vehicles for Active Safety program. With demand expanding beyond fully autonomous vehicles into driver-assistance applications, “one order or even two orders of magnitude reduction in cost are feasible.”“We are focused on delivering automotive-grade lidar that can actually be deployed at scale,” says MicroVision CEO Glen DeVos. “That means designing for cost, manufacturability, and integration from the start—not treating price as an afterthought.”MicroVision’s Lidar SystemTesla CEO Elon Musk famously dismissed lidar in 2019 as “a fool’s errand,” arguing that cameras and radar alone were sufficient for automated driving. A credible path to sub-$200 pricing would fundamentally alter the calculus of autonomous-car design by lowering the cost of adding precise three-dimensional sensing to mainstream vehicles. The shift reflects a broader industry trend toward solid-state lidar designs optimized for low-cost, high-volume manufacturing rather than maximum range or resolution.Before those economics can be evaluated, however, it’s important to understand what MicroVision is proposing to build.The company’s Movia S is a solid-state lidar. Mounted at the corners of a vehicle, the sensor sends out 905-nanometer-wavelength laser pulses and measures how long it takes for light reflected from the surfaces of nearby objects to return. The arrangement of the beam emitters and receivers provides a fixed field of view designed for 180-degree horizontal coverage rather than full 360-degree scanning typical of traditional mechanical units. The company says the unit can detect objects at distances of up to roughly 200 meters under favorable weather conditions—compared with the roughly 300-meter radius scanned by mechanical systems—and supports frame rates suitable for real-time perception in driver-assistance systems. Earlier mechanical lidars, used spinning components to steer their beams but the Movia S is a phased-arraysystem. It controls the amplitude and phase of the signals across an array of antenna elements to steer the beam. The unit is designed to meet automotive requirements for vibration tolerance, temperature range, and environmental sealing.MicroVision’s pricing targets might sound aggressive, but they are not without precedent. The lidar industry has already experienced one major cost reset over the past decade.“Automakers are not buying a single sensor in isolation... They are designing a perception system, and cost only matters if the system as a whole is viable.” –Glen DeVos, MicroVisionAround 2016 and 2017, mechanical lidar systems used in early autonomous driving research often sold for close to $100,000. Those units relied on spinning assemblies to sweep laser beams across a full 360 degrees, which made them expensive to build and difficult to ruggedize for consumer vehicles.“Back then, a 64-beam Velodyne lidar cost around $80,000,” says Radha.Comparable mechanical lidars from multiple suppliers now sell in the $10,000 to $20,000 range. That roughly tenfold drop helps explain why suppliers now believe another steep price reduction is possible. “For solid-state devices, it is feasible to bring the cost down even more when manufacturing at high volume,” Radha says. With demand expanding beyond fully autonomous vehicles into driver-assistance applications, “one order or even two orders of magnitude reduction in cost are feasible.”Solid-State Lidar Design ChallengesLower cost, however, does not come for free. The same design choices that enable solid-state lidar to scale also introduce new constraints.“Unlike mechanical lidars, which provide full 360-degree coverage, solid-state lidars tend to have a much smaller field of view,” Radha says. Many cover 180 degrees or less.That limitation shifts the burden from the sensor to the system. Automakers will need to deploy three or four solid-state lidars around a vehicle to achieve full coverage. Even so, Radha notes, the total cost can still undercut that of a single mechanical unit.What changes is integration. Multiple sensors must be aligned, calibrated, and synchronized so their data can be fused accurately. The engineering is manageable, but it adds complexity that price targets alone do not capture.DeVos says MicroVision’s design choices reflect that reality. “Automakers are not buying a single sensor in isolation,” he says. “They are designing a perception system, and cost only matters if the system as a whole is viable.”Those system-level tradeoffs help explain where low-cost lidar is most likely to appear first.Most advanced driver assistance systems today rely on cameras and radar, which are significantly cheaper than lidar. Cameras provide dense visual information, while radar offers reliable range and velocity data, particularly in poor weather. Radha estimates that lidar remains roughly an order of magnitude more expensive than automotive radar.But at prices in the $100 to $200 range, that gap narrows enough to change design decisions.“At that point, lidar becomes appealing because of its superior capability in precise 3D detection and tracking,” Radha says.Rather than replacing existing sensors, lower-cost lidar would likely augment them, adding redundancy and improving performance in complex environments that are challenging for electronic perception systems. That incremental improvement aligns more closely with how ADAS features are deployed today than with the leap to full vehicle autonomy.MicroVision is not alone in pursuing solid-state lidar, and several suppliers including Chinese firms Hesai and RoboSense and other major suppliers such as Luminar and Velodyne have announced long-term cost targets below $500. What distinguishes current claims is the explicit focus on sub-$200 pricing tied to production volume rather than future prototypes or limited pilot runs.Some competitors continue to prioritize long-range performance for autonomous vehicles, which pushes cost upward. Others have avoided aggressive pricing claims until they secure firm production commitments from automakers.That caution reflects a structural challenge: Reaching consumer-level pricing requires large, predictable demand. Without it, few suppliers can justify the manufacturing investments needed to achieve true economies of scale.Evaluating Lidar Performance MetricsEven if low-cost lidar becomes manufacturable, another question remains: How should its performance be judged?From a systems-engineering perspective, Radha says cost milestones often overshadow safety metrics.“The key objective of ADAS and autonomous systems is improving safety,” he says. Yet there is no universally adopted metric that directly expresses safety gains from a given sensor configuration.Researchers instead rely on perception benchmarks such as mean Average Precision, or mAP, which measures how accurately a system detects and tracks objects in its environment. Including such metrics alongside cost targets, says Radha, would clarify what performance is preserved or sacrificed as prices fall.IEEE Spectrum has covered lidar extensively, often focusing on technical advances in scanning, range, and resolution. What distinguishes the current moment is the renewed focus on economics rather than raw capabilityIf solid-state lidar can reliably reach sub-$200 pricing, it will not invalidate Elon Musk’s skepticism—but it will weaken one of its strongest foundations. When cost stops being the dominant objection, automakers will have to decide whether leaving lidar out is a technical judgment or a strategic one.That decision, more than any single price claim, may determine whether lidar finally becomes a routine component of vehicle safety systems.",

        "text": "Hillary Taymour's creative vision continues to evolve alongside the current state of the world, the designer's Collina Strada-verse acting as its own safe space amidst all the harsh realities that remain out of our control. Taymour has built an immersive world where rules are meant to be broken, and norms encouraged to be challenged, crafting a colorful, chaotically cohesive universe where everyone who enters is free to be themselves. On the heels of the Spring/Summer 2026 \"Shade\" showcase – which commented on the duality of light and dark – comes Fall/Winter 2026's \"The World Is A Vampire.\"\"As the metaphorical and literal weather worsens outside, we withdraw into self-made sanctuaries. After all, a vampire cannot enter unless invited in,\" begin the show notes, contextualizing the new Collina chapter we're witnessing.\"We bundle up inside, draw the curtains to shut out the light and the noise, and dream of better worlds outside our windows. The snow falls delicately with intention, grace, and poise inside our perfect satin-lined snow globes. No crusty banks of slippery, nasty ICE on our streets. We wrap ourselves in translucent layers, and organza collars rise at the neck in protection. We start to fade from the mirror, because we don't reflect this brutal world; we're only seen on our own terms. The world is trying to turn us, but we're hanging on to humanity, even as our fangs sharpen with disillusionment. Despite all our rage, we are still just bats in a cage, but at least our fur is plant-based, and our cage is Collina.\"Complementing the new collection – which leaned into a darker color palette than typical for Taymour – came vampy beauty looks and an even vampier, yet still-classic Collina Strada soundtrack.  However, the Fall/Winter 2026 footwear collaborations proved a particular high point of the showcase. KEEN was the official footwear partner of the show, presenting reworked iterations of two of its classic silhouettes: the Targhee EXP Collina Strada Boot and the Jasper Rocks Collina Strada Sneaker. Converse also contributed a pair of low-top Chuck Taylors, reimagined through the Collina lens.Take a closer look at this season's footwear in the gallery above, and read the full interview with Hillary Taymour below.Let's start with the name of the collection: \"The World Is a Vampire.\" Why did you choose that name? Everything feels really soul-sucking right now. There's a lot of energy being drained out of us. We need to figure out how to protect ourselves because the vampire can't come in unless you let it inside.How do you use Collina Strada as an outlet in this chaotic world in which we often feel as though we have no control?I just try to make a safe space for everyone to express themselves, and right now, I just want to be a strong woman-owned business that can fight for our own rights, be stable, and support our community. I try to be the best version of myself to support myself, my team, and everyone.One of my favorite parts of your show every season is the soundtrack. Could you share more about how you curated this year's? I worked with TT.BRITT on the soundtrack. He was amazing. We worked for a while to get this perfect vampy energy, but it still feels very modern and fun. So many layers.The footwear was incredible – could you tell me more about the collaborations? We have a collaboration coming out with KEEN in October, which I'm super excited about. We did two silhouettes with them. Then there's also a Converse collaboration in there, too.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",
