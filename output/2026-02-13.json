        "text": "White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler listens as President Barack Obama speaks at an installation ceremony for FBI Director James Comey at FBI Headquarters, in Washington, Oct. 28, 2013. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak, File)2026-02-13T02:01:40Z\n                                        NEW YORK (AP) — Kathy Ruemmler, the top lawyer at storied investment bank Goldman Sachs and former White House counsel to President Barack Obama, announced her resignation Thursday, after emails between her and Jeffrey Epstein showed a close relationship where she described him as an “older brother” and downplayed his sex crimes.Ruemmler said in a statement that she would “step down as Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel of Goldman Sachs as of June 30, 2026.”Up until her resignation, Ruemmler repeatedly tried to distance herself from the emails and other correspondence and had been defiant that she would not resign from Goldman’s top legal post, which she had held since 2020.While Ruemmler has called Epstein a “monster” in recent statements, she had a much different relationship with Epstein before he was arrested a second time for sex crimes in 2019 and later killed himself in a Manhattan jail. Ruemmler called Epstein “Uncle Jeffrey” in emails and said she adored him.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIn a statement before her resignation, a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said Ruemmler “regrets ever knowing him.”In her statement Thursday, Ruemmler said: “Since I joined Goldman Sachs six years ago, it has been my privilege to help oversee the firm’s legal, reputational, and regulatory matters; to enhance our strong risk management processes; and to ensure that we live by our core value of integrity in everything we do. My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs’ interests first.”\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nGoldman CEO David Solomonsaid in a separate statement: “As one of the most accomplished professionals in her field, Kathy has also been a mentor and friend to many of our people, and she will be missed. I accepted her resignation, and I respect her decision.”\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nDuring her time in private practice after she left the White House in 2014, Ruemmler received several expensive gifts from Epstein, including luxury handbags and a fur coat. The gifts were given after Epstein had already been convicted of sex crimes in 2008 and was registered as a sex offender.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“So lovely and thoughtful! Thank you to Uncle Jeffrey!!!” Ruemmler wrote to Epstein in 2018. Historically, Wall Street frowns on gift-giving between clients and bankers or Wall Street lawyers, particularly high-end gifts that could pose a conflict of interest. Goldman Sachs requires its employees to get preapproval before receiving or giving gifts from clients, according to the company’s code of conduct, partly in order to not run afoul of anti-bribery laws. As late as December, Goldman CEO David Solomon described Ruemmler as an “excellent lawyer” and said she had his full faith and backing.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                KEN SWEET\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Ken is a national writer on banking and consumer issues.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto",

        "title": "Virginia Supreme Court rules US Marine’s adoption of an Afghan war orphan will stand",
        "text": "Marine Maj. Joshua Mast and his wife, Stephanie, arrive at Circuit Court, Thursday, March 30, 2023 in Charlottesville, Va. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen, File)2026-02-12T19:51:42Z\n                                        The Virginia Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a U.S. Marine and his wife will keep an Afghan orphan they brought home in defiance of a U.S. government decision to reunite her with her Afghan family. The decision likely ends a bitter, yearslong legal battle over the girl’s fate. In 2020, a judge in Fluvanna County, Virginia, granted Joshua and Stephanie Mast an adoption of the child, who was then 7,000 miles away in Afghanistan living with a family the Afghan government decided were her relatives.Four justices on the Virginia Supreme Court on Thursday signed onto an opinion reversing two lower courts’ rulings that found the adoption was so flawed it was void from the moment it was issued. The justices wrote that a Virginia law that cements adoption orders after six months bars the child’s Afghan relatives from challenging the court, no matter how flawed its orders and even if the adoption was obtained by fraud.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThree justices issued a scathing dissent, calling what happened in this court “wrong,” “cancerous” and “like a house built on a rotten foundation.”An attorney for the Masts declined to comment, citing an order from the circuit court not to discuss the details of the case publicly. Lawyers representing the Afghan family said they were not yet prepared to comment. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe child was injured on the battlefield in Afghanistan in September 2019 when U.S. soldiers raided a rural compound. The child’s parents and siblings were killed. Soldiers brought her to a hospital at an American military base. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe raid was targeting terrorists who had come into Afghanistan from a neighboring country; some believed she was not Afghan and tried to make a case for bringing her to the U.S. But the State Department, under President Donald Trump’s first administration, insisted the U.S. was obligated under international law to work with the Afghan government and the International Committee of the Red Cross to unite the child with her closest surviving relatives. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe Afghan government determined she was Afghan and vetted a man who claimed to be her uncle. The U.S. government agreed and brought her to the family. The uncle chose to give her to his son and his new wife, who raised her for 18 months in Afghanistan.Meanwhile, Mast and his wife convinced courts in rural Fluvanna County, Virginia, to grant them custody and then a series of adoption orders, continuing to claim she was the “stateless” daughter of foreign fighters.Judge Richard Moore granted them a final adoption in December 2020. When the six-month statute of limitations ran out, the child was still in Afghanistan living with her relatives, who testified they had no idea a judge was giving the girl to another family. Mast contacted them through intermediaries and tried to get them to send the girl to the U.S. for medical treatment but they refused to let her go alone. When the U.S. military withdrew from Afghanistan and the Taliban took over, the family agreed to leave and Mast worked his military contacts to get them on an evacuation flight. Mast then took the baby from them at a refugee resettlement center in Virginia, and they haven’t seen her since.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe Afghans challenged the adoption, claiming the court had no authority over a foreign child and the adoption orders were based on Mast repeatedly misleading the judge. The Virginia Supreme Court on Thursday wrote that the law prohibiting challenges to an adoption after six months is designed to create permanency, so a child is not bounced from one home to another. The only way to undercut it is to argue that a parent’s constitutional rights were violated.The lower courts had found that the Afghan couple had a right to challenge the adoption because they were the girl’s “de facto” parents when they came to the United States.Four of the Supreme Court judges — D. Arthur Kelsey, Stephen R. McCullough, Teresa M. Chafin, Wesley G. Russell Jr. — disagreed.“We find no legal merit” in the argument that “that they were ‘de facto’ parents of the child and that no American court could constitutionally sever that relationship,” they wrote. They pointed to Fluvanna County Circuit Court Judge Richard Moore’s findings that the Afghan couple “are not and never were parents” of the child, because they had no order from an Afghan court and had not proven any biological relationship to her. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe Afghans had refused DNA testing, saying it could not reliably prove a familial connection between opposite-gender half-cousins. They insisted that it didn’t matter, because Afghanistan claimed the girl as its citizen and got to determine her next-of-kin. The Supreme Court leaned heavily on a 38-page document written by Judge Moore, who granted the adoption, then presided over a dozen hearings after the Afghans challenged it. He wrote that he trusted the Masts more than the Afghans, and believed that Masts’ motivations were noble while the Afghans were misrepresenting their relationship to the child. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe Supreme Court also dismissed the federal government’s long insistence that Trump’s first administration had made a foreign policy decision to unite her with her Afghan relatives, and a court in Virginia has no authority to undo it. The government submitted filings in court predicting dire outcomes if the baby was allowed to remain with the Marine: it could be viewed as “endorsing an act of international child abduction,” threaten international security pacts and be used as propaganda by Islamic extremists — potentially endangering U.S soldiers overseas.But the Justice Department in Trump’s second administration abruptly changed course. The Supreme Court noted in its opinion that the Justice Department had been granted permission to make arguments in the case, but withdrew its request to do so on the morning of oral arguments last year, saying it “has now had an opportunity to reevaluate its position in this case.”The Supreme Court returned repeatedly to Moore’s finding that giving the girl to the family “was not a decision the United States initiated, but rather consented to or acquiesced in.” The three judges who dissented were unsparing in their criticism of both the Masts and the circuit court that granted him the adoption. “A dispassionate review of this case reveals a scenario suffused with arrogance and privilege. Worse, it appears to have worked,” begins the dissent, written by Justice Thomas P. Mann, and signed by Chief Justice Cleo E. Powell and LeRoy F. Millette, Jr.A Virginia court never had the right to give the child to the Masts, the dissent said.They castigated the Masts for “brazenly” misleading the courts during their quest to adopt the girl. “We must recognize what an adoption really is: the severance and termination of the rights naturally flowing to an otherwise legitimate claimant to parental authority. Of course, the process must be impeccable. An evolved society could not sanction anything less than that. And here, it was less,” Mann wrote. “If this process was represented by a straight line, (the Masts) went above it, under it, around it, and then blasted right through it until there was no line at all — just fragments collapsing into a cavity.”\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JULIET LINDERMAN\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Linderman is a national investigative reporter based in Baltimore.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto\n    \n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n            \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                CLAIRE GALOFARO\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Galofaro is a national writer on AP’s investigations team.

        "title": "Homeland Security shutdown seems certain as funding talks between White House and Democrats stall",
        "text": "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., right, is joined by Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., left, during the Senate Republican policy luncheon news conference at the Capitol, Tuesday, Feb., 10, 2026, in Washington. (AP Photo/Rod Lamkey, Jr.)2026-02-12T19:25:31Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — A shutdown for the Department of Homeland Security appeared certain Thursday as lawmakers in the House and Senate were set to leave Washington for a 10-day break and negotiations with the White House over Democrats’ demands for new restrictions had stalled. The White House and Democrats have traded offers in recent days as the Democrats have said they want curbs on President Donald Trump’s broad campaign of immigration enforcement. They have demanded better identification for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal law enforcement officers, a new code of conduct for those agencies and more use of judicial warrants, among other requests. The White House sent its most recent offer late Wednesday, including what Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said were “concessions” on the part of the Republican administration. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThune would not say what those concessions were, though, and he acknowledged the sides were “a long ways toward a solution” even as the Senate is scheduled to vote again on the DHS funding. Democrats did not respond publicly to the White House offer, but Democratic senators voted against a funding bill for the department before leaving town, meaning the funding will expire Saturday without further action. The bill was rejected, 52-47, short of the 60 votes needed for passage. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nLawmakers in both chambers were on notice to return to Washington if the two sides struck a deal to end the expected shutdown. But for now, Democrats say they need to see real changes before they will support DHS funding. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nAmericans want accountability and “an end to the chaos,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Thursday before the vote. “The White House and congressional Republicans must listen and deliver.” Schumer said it was not enough that the administration had announced an end to the immigration crackdown in Minnesota that led to thousands of arrests and the fatal shootings of two protesters. “We need legislation to rein in ICE and end the violence,” Schumer said, or the actions of the administration “could be reversed tomorrow on a whim.” \n    \n        \n    \n\nJudicial warrants a sticking point Democrats made the demands for new restrictions on ICE and other federal law enforcement after ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Jan. 24, Some Republicans suggested that new restrictions were necessary. Renee Good was shot by ICE agents on Jan. 7.Thune, who has urged Democrats and the White House to work together, indicated that one sticking point is the Democratic request for more judicial warrants.“The issue of warrants is going to be very hard for the White House or for Republicans,” Thune said. “But I think there are a lot of other areas where there has been give, and progress.” In a list of demands they sent to the White House last week, Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said DHS officers should not be able to enter private property without a judicial warrant and that warrant procedures and standards should be improved. They have said they want an end to “roving patrols” of agents who are targeting people in the streets and in their homes. \n    \n        \n    \n\nMost immigration arrests are carried out under administrative warrants. Those are internal documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize the arrest of a specific person but do not permit officers to forcibly enter private homes or other nonpublic spaces without consent. Traditionally, only warrants signed by judges carry that authority. But an internal ICE memo obtained by The Associated Press last month authorizes ICE officers to use force to enter a residence based solely on a more narrow administrative warrant to arrest someone with a final order of removal, a move that advocates say collides with Fourth Amendment protections. \n    \n        \n    \n\nWhite House silence Congress is trying to renegotiate the DHS spending bill after Trump agreed to a Democratic request that it be separated from a larger spending measure that became law last week. That package extended homeland security funding at current levels only through Friday.Schumer and Jeffries have said they want immigration officers to remove their masks, to show identification and to better coordinate with local authorities. They have also demanded a stricter use-of-force policy for the federal officers, legal safeguards at detention centers and a prohibition on tracking protesters with body-worn cameras.Democrats also say Congress should end indiscriminate arrests and require that before a person can be detained, authorities have verified that the person is not a U.S. citizen.Republicans have been largely opposed to most of the items on Democrats’ list. But Trump has remained relatively silent about the talks. \n    \n        \n    \n\nImpact of a shutdownRepublicans tried to temporarily extend the funding, but Democrats blocked that bill as well. “We will not support an extension of the status quo,” Schumer said. The impact of a DHS shutdown is likely to be minimal at first. It would not likely block any of the immigration enforcement operations, as Trump’s tax and spending cut bill passed last year gave ICE about $75 billion to expand detention capacity and bolster enforcement operations.But the other agencies in the department — including the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Secret Service and the Coast Guard — could take a bigger hit over time. Gregg Phillips, an associate administrator at FEMA, said at a hearing this week that its disaster relief fund has sufficient balances to continue emergency response activities during a shutdown, but would become seriously strained in the event of a catastrophic disaster. Phillips said that while the agency continues to respond to threats like flooding and winter storms, long-term planning and coordination with state and local partners is “irrevocably impacted.”___Associated Press writers Seung Min Kim and Rebecca Santana contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., speaks during a news conference at Capitol Hill, Wednesday, Feb. 11, 2026, in Washington. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)2026-02-12T17:57:31Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge agreed Thursday to temporarily block the Pentagon from punishing Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, a former Navy pilot, for participating in a video that called on troops to resist unlawful orders.U.S. District Judge Richard Leon ruled that Pentagon officials violated Kelly’s First Amendment free speech rights and “threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees.”Kelly, who represents Arizona, sued in federal court to block his Jan. 5 censure from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.In November, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers appeared on a video in which they urged troops to uphold the Constitution and not to follow unlawful military directives from the Trump administration.Republican President Donald Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post days later. \n    \n        \n    \n\nHegseth said Kelly’s censure was “a necessary process step” to proceedings that could result in a demotion from the senator’s retired rank of captain and subsequent reduction in retirement pay.The judge concluded that Kelly’s speech is entitled to full First Amendment protection. Leon wrote, “Horsefeathers!” in response to the government’s argument that Kelly is trying to exempt himself from the rules of military justice.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n“Rather than trying to shrink the First Amendment liberties of retired servicemembers, Secretary Hegseth and his fellow Defendants might reflect and be grateful for the wisdom and expertise that retired servicemembers have brought to public discussions and debate on military matters in our Nation over the past 250 years,” Leon wrote.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“If so,” he added, “they will more fully appreciate why the Founding Fathers made free speech the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights!”The Pentagon did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the judge’s ruling.\n    \n        \n    \n\nKelly said in a video statement posted after the ruling that the case was about more than just him and that the administration “was sending a message to millions of retired veterans that they too can be censured or demoted just for speaking out.”He added that the ruling was unlikely the end: “This might not be over yet, because this president and this administration do not know how to admit when they’re wrong.”The 90-second video was first posted on a social media account belonging to Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan. Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania also appeared in the video. All of the participants are veterans of the armed services or intelligence agencies.The Pentagon began investigating Kelly in late November, citing a federal law that allows retired service members to be recalled to active duty on orders of the defense secretary for possible court-martial or other punishment. Hegseth has said Kelly was the only one of the six lawmakers to be investigated because he is the only one who formally retired from the military and still falls under the Pentagon’s jurisdiction.\n    \n        \n    \n\nKelly’s lawyers said the Pentagon’s censure of Kelly — and its efforts to reduce his retirement grade and pay — are an unprecedented attack on the rights of veterans to publicly debate national security issues.“Defendants assert an absolute and unreviewable authority to impose military punishment on a retired veteran and sitting United States Senator for engaging in speech a civilian political appointee dislikes. That position is as alarming as it is unprecedented,” they wrote.Government lawyers said the case “is not about legislative independence or freedom of speech in civilian society.”“Instead, this case involves a retired military officer who seeks to use his military status as a sword and his legislative position as a shield against the consequences of his actions in military personnel matters,” they wrote.Hegseth, the Defense Department, Navy Secretary John Phelan and the Navy are named as defendants in the lawsuit.Leon was nominated to the bench by Republican President George W.

        "title": "Key Democrat accuses the Justice Department of ‘spying’ on lawmakers reviewing Epstein files",
        "text": "Committee Ranking Member Rep. Jamie Raskin D-Md. Speaks as Attorney General Pam Bondi testifies before a House Judiciary Committee oversight hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Feb. 11, 2026, in Washington. (AP Photo/Tom Brenner)2026-02-12T15:41:59Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — A top Democrat is calling for a watchdog investigation after photographs emerged suggesting that the Justice Department has been tracking the search history of lawmakers who are reviewing files from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, asked the Justice Department’s inspector general to investigate what he characterized as “spying” on members of Congress who this week have reviewed less-redacted versions of the Epstein files at a department annex and on department-owned computers.Photographs taken during Attorney General Pam Bondi’s hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday showed her holding a binder open to a page that said “Jayapal Pramila Search History” and that listed a series of documents that were apparently reviewed. Pramila Jayapal is a Democratic congresswoman and was among the Judiciary Committee members who pressed Bondi during the hearing about the department’s handling of the Epstein files.\n    \n        \n    \n\nJayapal called it “totally unacceptable” and said lawmakers will be “demanding a full accounting” of how the department is using the search history. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n“Bondi has enough time to spy on Members of Congress, but can’t find it in herself to apologize to the survivors of Epstein’s horrific abuse,” Jayapal said in a post on X. A bipartisan contingent of lawmakers has traveled in recent days to a Justice Department outpost to review less-redacted records from the files, but some who have seen the documents have complained that too much information about Epstein associates remains withheld from view. The Trump administration Justice Department said last month that it was releasing more than 3 million pages along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images related to Epstein investigations.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nSpokespeople for the Justice Department did not immediately return a request seeking comment Thursday. Representatives for the inspector general’s office also did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIn a statement, Raskin said that not only had the Justice Department withheld records from lawmakers “but now Bondi and her team are spying on members of Congress conducting oversight in yet another blatant attempt to intrude into Congress’s oversight processes.”He added: “DOJ must immediately cease tracking any Members’ searches, open up the Epstein review to senior congressional staff, and publicly release all files—with all the survivors’ information, and only the survivors’ information, properly redacted—as required by federal law.”\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                ERIC TUCKER\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Tucker covers national security in Washington for The Associated Press, with a focus on the FBI and Justice Department.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto\n    \n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n            \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                ALANNA DURKIN RICHER\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Richer covers the Justice Department and federal courts.

        "text": "President Donald Trump listens to a question from a reporter during an event with Environmental Protection Agency director Lee Zeldin to announce the EPA will no longer regulate greenhouse gases, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Thursday, Feb. 12, 2026, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)2026-02-12T22:56:44Z\n                                        President Donald Trump on Thursday revoked the 2009 endangerment finding, which has long been the central basis for U.S. action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change.But in making the announcement, Trump and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin made false claims regarding the government declaration, climate change, and energy.Here’s a closer look at the facts.___TRUMP: “Known as the endangerment finding, this determination had no basis in fact, had none whatsoever, and it had no basis in law.”THE FACTS: This is false. The endangerment finding was adopted in 2009 by the EPA after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases are air pollutants that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act. “The idea that the endangerment finding has no basis in law is ludicrous,” said Ann Carlson, a professor of environmental law at the University of California, Los Angeles. “The Supreme Court in Massachusetts v. EPA specifically directed the Environmental Protection Agency to determine whether greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. The endangerment finding is the result.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nScientific evidence to support the endangerment finding was provided by the EPA at the time of its inception and is still available on the agency’s website today.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nMultiple federal courts have upheld the endangerment finding since it was adopted 16 years ago. ___\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nTRUMP: “We’ve basically stopped all windmills in this country. It’s the most expensive energy you can get.”THE FACTS: Onshore wind is one of the cheapest sources of electricity generation, with new wind farms expected to produce around $30 per megawatt hour, according to July estimates from the Energy Information Administration.This compares to a new natural gas plant, around $65 per megawatt hour, or a new advanced nuclear reactor, which runs over $80. Offshore wind is among the sources of new power generation that will cost the most to build and operate, at $88 per megawatt hour, the EIA said in July.\n    \n        \n    \n\n___ TRUMP, asked about the cost to health and the environment: “It has nothing to do with public health. This is all a scam, a giant scam. This was a rip off of the country by Obama and Biden, and let’s say Obama started it and got it rolling and a terrible rip off.”THE FACTS: Thousands of peer-reviewed scientific studies connect health harms to climate change. They find increasing deaths from heat waves, extreme weather such as hurricanes and floods and air pollution from worsening wildfires. A 2021 study in Nature Climate Change calculated that globally about 9,700 people die a year from heat-related deaths attributable to human-caused climate change, based on data from 732 cities, including more than 200 in the United States.A separate study last year listed dozens of climate change health harms and concluded, using the EPA’s own calculation method, that the health costs are at least $10 billion a year, probably much more.The science of climate change dates back nearly 170 years to studies done by American Eunice Foote showing that carbon dioxide heated cylinders with thermometers inside more than ambient air. The first national climate assessment, done in 2000, before Obama and Biden, “concluded that climate variability and change are likely to increase morbidity and mortality risks.”\n    \n        \n    \n\n___ZELDIN: “The Obama and Biden administrations used the endangerment finding to steamroll into existence a left-wing wish, including electric vehicle mandates.”THE FACTS: Trump has made this claim before. There was no federal mandate to force the purchase of EVs.“If you looked at some of the tables that were in the Biden rules, you could see that there were a variety of different ways that companies could comply with the standards,” said Carrie Jenks, the executive director of Harvard Law School’s environmental and energy law program. “The endangerment finding nor the regulations mandated a shift from one type of vehicle to another.”Former President Joe Biden did set up a non-binding goal that EVs make up half of new cars sold by 2030. Trump issued an executive order on his first day in office revoking that goal.\n    \n        \n    \n\nBiden’s policies tightened restrictions on pollution from gas-powered cars and trucks in an effort to encourage Americans to buy EVs and car companies to shift from gas-powered vehicles to electric cars. ___Associated Press writers Seth Borenstein and Matthew Daly in Washington contributed to this report. ___Find AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                MELISSA GOLDIN\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Goldin debunks, analyzes and tracks misinformation for The Associated Press.

        "title": "Trump’s EPA revokes scientific finding that underpinned US fight against climate change",
        "text": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) building is seen in Washington on Sept. 21, 2017. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)2026-02-12T18:44:01Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Thursday revoked a scientific finding that long has been the central basis for U.S. action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change, the most aggressive move by the president to roll back climate regulations.The rule finalized by the Environmental Protection Agency rescinds a 2009 government declaration known as the endangerment finding that determined that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.The endangerment finding by the Obama administration is the legal underpinning of nearly all climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet. Legal challenges are certain for an action that repeals all greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars and trucks, and could unleash a broader undoing of climate regulations on stationary sources such as power plants and oil and gas facilities, experts say. Overturning the finding will “raise more havoc” than other actions by the Trump administration to roll back environmental rules, said Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the UCLA School of Law. \n    \n        \n    \n\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who has pivoted the agency toward a business-friendly approach that has repeatedly reversed climate regulations, said repeal of the endangerment finding “will be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America.” \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nEnvironmental groups described the move as the single biggest attack in U.S. history against federal authority to address climate change.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nZeldin announced the rule completion on Thursday alongside President Donald Trump. The EPA also said it will propose a two-year delay to a Biden-era rule restricting greenhouse gas emissions by cars and light trucks.Zeldin, a former Republican congressman who was tapped by Trump to lead EPA last year, has criticized his predecessors in Democratic administrations, saying that in the name of tackling climate change, they were “willing to bankrupt the country.” \n    \n        \n    \n\nWithdrawing the endangerment finding “is the most important step taken by the Trump administration so far to return to energy and economic sanity,’' said Myron Ebell, a conservative activist who has questioned the science behind climate change. The decision “will make our economy more productive and benefit consumers, most immediately by allowing auto manufacturers to produce the vehicles that people want to buy,” he said.Supreme Court has upheld endangerment findingThe Supreme Court ruled in a 2007 case that planet-warming greenhouse gases, caused by burning of oil and other fossil fuels, are air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.Since the high court’s decision, in a case known as Massachusetts v. EPA, courts have uniformly rejected legal challenges to the endangerment finding, including a 2023 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.The endangerment finding is widely considered the legal foundation that underpins a series of regulations intended to protect against threats made increasingly severe by climate change. That includes deadly floods, extreme heat waves, catastrophic wildfires and other natural disasters in the United States and around the world.\n    \n        \n    \n\nGina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator who served as White House climate adviser in the Biden administration, called the Trump administration’s actions reckless. “This EPA would rather spend its time in court working for the fossil fuel industry than protecting us from pollution and the escalating impacts of climate change,” she said.EPA has a clear scientific and legal obligation to regulate greenhouse gases, McCarthy said, adding that evidence backing up the endangerment finding “has only grown stronger” as the health and environmental hazards of climate change have “become impossible to ignore.”David Doniger, a climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Trump and Zeldin are trying to use repeal of the finding as a “kill shot’’ that would allow the administration to make nearly all climate regulations invalid. The repeal could erase current limits on greenhouse gas pollution from cars, factories, power plants and other sources and could prevent future administrations from proposing rules to address global warming.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe EPA action follows an executive order from Trump that directed the agency to submit a report on “the legality and continuing applicability” of the endangerment finding. Conservatives and some congressional Republicans have long sought to undo what they consider overly restrictive and economically damaging rules to limit greenhouse gases that cause global warming.\n    \n        \n    \n\nTailpipe emission limits targetedZeldin and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have moved to drastically scale back limits on tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks. Rules imposed under Democratic President Joe Biden were intended to encourage U.S. automakers to build and sell more electric vehicles. The transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.The Trump administration announced a proposal in December to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks. The EPA said its two-year delay to a Biden-era rule on greenhouse gas emissions by cars and light trucks will give the agency time to develop a plan that better reflects the reality of slower EV sales, while promoting consumer choice and lowering prices.The mileage plan would significantly reduce requirements that set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline. Trump said the rule change will lower the price of new cars and increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.Environmental groups said the plan would keep polluting, gas-burning cars and trucks on U.S. roads for years to come, threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly.Biden-era standards for clean cars and trucks are among the most important and effective protections to address climate pollution, advocates say.___Follow the AP’s coverage of the Environmental Protection Agency at https://apnews.com/hub/us-environmental-protection-agency\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                MATTHEW DALY\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Daly covers climate, environment and energy policy for The Associated Press.

Weeds grow on walkways, the stands are empty and algae grows in the pools, giving the water a greenish hue.It is here that Wikie and Keijo, a mother and son pair of orcas, are floating. They were born in these pools, and for decades they performed in shows for crowds. But since the park’s closure in January 2025, they no longer have an audience. When they are alone, they “log”, or float at the water’s surface, according to a court-ordered report released last April. Continue reading...",

        "text": "Capitalism cares about our species’ prospects as much as a wolf cares about a lamb’s. But democratise our economy and a better world is within our graspWe have an urgent responsibility. Our existing economic system is incapable of addressing the social and ecological crises we face in the 21st century. When we look around we see an extraordinary paradox. On the one hand, we have access to remarkable new technologies and a collective capacity to produce more food, more stuff than we need or that the planet can afford. Yet at the same time, millions of people suffer in conditions of severe deprivation.What explains this paradox? Capitalism. By capitalism we do not mean markets, trade and entrepreneurship, which have been around for thousands of years before the rise of capitalism. By capitalism we mean something very odd and very specific: an economic system that boils down to a dictatorship run by the tiny minority who control capital – the big banks, the major corporations and the 1% who own the majority of investible assets. Even if we live in a democracy and have a choice in our political system, our choices never seem to change the economic system. Capitalists are the ones who determine what to produce, how to use our labour and who gets to benefit. The rest of us – the people who are actually doing the production – do not get a say.

        "text": "SummaryBernard Arnault has purchased approximately €407 million EUR in LVMH shares following a post-earnings stock dipThe move aligns with his January 27 pledge to increase the family's equity stake beyond 50% in 2026Filings reveal the acquisition of roughly 757,000 shares via holding companies Financière Agache and Christian Dior SEBernard Arnault is putting his money where his mouth is. Following a public vow to secure a definitive majority stake in his luxury empire, the LVMH Chairman and CEO has aggressively acquired approximately €407 million (approx. $440 million USD) worth of shares. The move comes immediately after the conglomerate reported mixed 2025 earnings, signaling a massive vote of confidence from Europe’s richest man during a noticeable market downturn.According to regulatory filings from the Paris Stock Exchange, Arnault’s family holding companies—Financière Agache and Christian Dior SE—purchased roughly 757,000 shares between January 28 and February 4. This buying spree kicked off just one day after Arnault explicitly told investors during an earnings call: \"This year, we will cross the 50% ownership threshold... We are confident in our business.\"The acquisition follows a sharp decline in LVMH’s stock price, which reportedly wiped out an estimated $15 billion USD from Arnault’s personal net worth in a single day. While the Arnault family already commands nearly 65% of voting rights, the push to own more than 50% of the actual equity is viewed by analysts as a symbolic \"icing on the cake\" designed to reassure markets amidst a cooling luxury sector.This latest consolidation is part of a broader strategy. Arnault’s accumulation follows an eight-month buying period in 2025 and coincides with other internal moves, including a recent €1 billion investment to increase LVMH's stake in cashmere specialist Loro Piana from 85% to 94%. The Arnault family currently holds approximately 49% of LVMH's share capital. Based on recent filings and Arnault's own declarations, the 50% equity milestone is expected to be officially crossed later this year.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "Italy&#x27;s Federica Brignone, gold medalist in an alpine ski, women&#x27;s super-G race, waves to supporters at the 2026 Winter Olympics, in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Italy, Thursday, Feb. 12, 2026. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)2026-02-12T14:09:23Z\n                                        MILAN (AP) — An all-time great comeback and a controversial exclusion are dominating the Milan Cortina Olympics on Day 6.Later Thursday, Chloe Kim of the United States seeks to become the first snowboarder to win three straight Olympic gold medals in women’s halfpipe. And NHL players on the U.S. and Canada teams are joining the action in their opening men’s hockey games.Brignone back in styleFor much of last year, it wasn’t clear if Italian skier Federica Brignone could compete at her home Olympics at all, let alone contend for a medal.She came away with gold in the women’s super-G on Thursday, following a year spent largely in rehab after breaking multiple bones in her leg. She only returned to racing last month.Brignone shrugged off difficult, foggy conditions to win her fourth career Olympic medal and become, at 35, the oldest female gold medalist in women’s Alpine skiing. Romane Miradoli of France took silver and Cornelia Huetter of Austria got bronze.\n    \n        \n    \n\nUkrainian slider excludedAs the men’s skeleton competition got under way, all the attention was on a Ukrainian athlete who wasn’t on the track.Vladyslav Heraskevych was barred from racing after refusing to give up his plan to race in a helmet commemorating athletes who have been killed since Russia invaded his country. The International Olympic Committee says it breaks rules against making statements on the field of play.IOC President Kirsty Coventry turned up at the sliding track in a last-minute bid to change Heraskevych’s mind ahead of the opening run of the competition Thursday morning.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nHeraskevych, who had been a contender for the medals, refused and was excluded from the Olympics.Heraskevych said it “looks like discrimination” to bar him from competing. Coventry, who said she’d hoped to find a compromise, was tearful on what she called an “emotional morning.”\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nCanada’s men and women win in hockeyConnor McDavid had three assists and Jordan Binnington made 26 saves to help Canada beat Czechia 5-0 in the opening game of their Olympic campaign.The U.S. men play their first Olympic game later Thursday against Latvia.The Canadian women responded after their worst-ever Olympic loss by beating Finland 5-0 to end the preliminary round. That sets up a quarterfinal meeting with Germany on Saturday.\n    \n        \n    \n\nUpset in freestyleIn a major upset, Cooper Woods of Australia won freestyle skiing gold in men’s moguls by edging Canadian great Mikael Kingsbury — the sport’s most decorated skier — on a tiebreaker.American skier Jessie Diggins overcame bruised ribs to take bronze in the women’s 10-kilometer cross-country skiing race. Frida Karlsson won her second gold medal of the Milan Cortina Games by leading a 1-2 finish for Sweden.Italian speedskater Francesca Lollobrigida, whose great aunt was movie star Gina Lollobrigida, won her second gold of the Olympics by a tenth of a second in the women’s 5,000 meters.Alessandro Haemmerle of Austria and Eliot Grondin of Canada repeated as gold and silver medalists, respectively, in men’s snowboardcross.Germany won the team luge, as it has done at every Olympics since the event was added in 2014.\n    \n        \n    \n\nLater Thursday, Arianna Fontana of Italy will go for a record-extending 13th career Olympic medal in short-track speedskating.___AP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

        "title": "Scientists say genetic analysis could greatly speed restoration of iconic American chestnut",
        "text": "Vernon Coffey, left, William Powell and Andy Newhouse prepare to harvest genetically modified chestnut samples at the State University of New York&#x27;s College of Environmental Science &amp; Forestry Lafayette Road Experiment Station in Syracuse, N.Y., Sept. 30, 2019. (AP Photo/Adrian Kraus, File)2026-02-12T19:00:41Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — Billions of American chestnut trees once covered the eastern United States. They soared in height, producing so many nuts that sellers moved them by train car. Every Christmas, they’re called to mind by the holiday lyric “chestnuts roasting on an open fire.”But by the 1950s, this venerable tree went functionally extinct, culled by a deadly airborne fungal blight and lethal root rot. A new study out Thursday in the journal Science provides hope for its revitalization, finding that the genetic testing of individual trees can reveal which are most likely to resist disease and grow tall, thus shortening how long it takes to plant the next, more robust, generation.A smaller gap between generations means a faster path to lots of disease-resistant trees that will once again be able to compete for space in Eastern forests. The authors hope that can occur in the coming decades.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“What’s new here is the engine that we’re creating for restoration,” said Jared Westbrook, lead author and director of science at The American Chestnut Foundation, which wants to return the tree to its native range that once stretched from Maine to Mississippi.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe American chestnut, sometimes called the “redwood of the East,” can grow quickly and reach more than 100 feet (30 meters), produce prodigious amounts of nutritious chestnuts and supply lumber favored for its straight grain and durability.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nBut it had little defense against foreign-introduced blight and root rot. Another type of chestnut, however, had evolved alongside those diseases. The Chinese chestnut had been introduced for its valuable nuts and it could resist diseases. But it isn’t as tall or competitive in U.S. forests, nor has it served the same critical role supporting other species.So, the authors want a tree with the characteristics of the American chestnut and the disease resistance of the Chinese chestnut.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThat goal is not new — scientists have been reaching for it for decades and made some progress.But it has been difficult because the American chestnut’s desirable traits are scattered across multiple spots along its genome, the DNA string that tells the tree how to develop and function.“It’s a very complex trait, and in that case, you can’t just select on one thing because you’ll select on linked things that are negative,” said John Lovell, senior author and researcher at the HudsonAlpha Genome Sequencing Center.Breed for disease resistance alone and the trees get shorter, less competitive.To deal with this, the authors sequenced the genome of multiple types of chestnuts and found the many places that correlated with the desired traits. They can then use that information to breed trees that are more likely to have desirable traits while maintaining high amounts of American chestnut DNA — roughly 70% to 85%.And genetic testing allows the process to move faster, revealing the best offspring years before their traits would be demonstrated by natural growth and encountering disease. The closer the gap between generations, the faster gains accumulate.\n    \n        \n    \n\nSteven Strauss, a professor of forest biotechnology at Oregon State University who wasn’t involved in the study, said the paper identified some promising genes. He wants scientists to be able to edit the genes themselves, a possibly faster, more precise path to a better tree. In an accompanying commentary piece in Science, he says regulations can bog down these ideas for years.“People just won’t consider biotech because it is on the other side of this social, legal barrier” and that’s shortsighted, he said.For people who have closely studied the American chestnut, the work begs an almost existential question: How much can the American chestnut be changed and still be an American chestnut?“The American chestnut has a unique evolutionary history, it has a specific place in the North American ecosystem,” said Donald Edward Davis, author of the American chestnut, an environmental history. “Having that tree and no other trees would be sort of the gold standard.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nHe said the tree was a keystone species, useful to humans and vital to bigger populations of squirrels, chipmunks and black bears — hybrids might not be as majestic or effective. He was pleased that the authors included some surviving American chestnuts in their proposal, but favored an approach that relied on them more heavily.“Not that the hybrid approach is itself bad, it is just that why not try to get the wild American trees back in the forest, back in the ecosystem, and exhaust all possibilities from doing that before we move on to some of these other methods?” he said.Lovells said resurrecting the species requires introducing genetic diversity from outside the traditional pool of American chestnut trees. The study authors’ goal is tall, resilient trees and they are optimistic. \n    \n        \n    \n\n“I think if we only select American chestnut (tree genes), period, there’s going to be too small of a pool and we’re going to end up with a genetic bottleneck that will lead to extinction in the future,” said Lovell.___The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

        "title": "LEDs Enter the Nanoscale",
        "text": "MicroLEDs, with pixels just micrometers across, have long been a byword in the display world. Now, microLED-makers have begun shrinking their creations into the uncharted nano realm. In January, a startup named Polar Light Technologies unveiled prototype blue LEDs less than 500 nanometers across. This raises a tempting question: How far can LEDs shrink?We know the answer is, at least, considerably smaller. In the past year, two different research groups have demonstrated LED pixels at sizes of 100 nm or less.These are some of the smallest LEDs ever created. They leave much to be desired in their efficiency—but one day, nanoLEDs could power ultra-high-resolution virtual reality displays and high-bandwidth on-chip photonics. And the key to making even tinier LEDs, if these early attempts are any precedents, may be to make more unusual LEDs.New Approaches to LEDTake Polar Light’s example. Like many LEDs, the Sweden-based startup’s diodes are fashioned from III-V semiconductors like gallium nitride (GaN) and indium gallium nitride (InGaN). Unlike many LEDs, which are etched into their semiconductor from the top down, Polar Light’s are instead fabricated by building peculiarly shaped hexagonal pyramids from the bottom up. Polar Light designed its pyramids for the larger microLED market, and plans to start commercial production in late 2026. But they also wanted to test how small their pyramids could shrink. So far, they’ve made pyramids 300 nm across. “We haven’t reached the limit, yet,” says Oskar Fajerson, Polar Light’s CEO. “Do we know the limit? No, we don’t, but we can [make] them smaller.”Elsewhere, researchers have already done that. Some of the world’s tiniest LEDs come from groups who have foregone the standard III-V semiconductors in favor of other types of LEDs—like OLEDs. “We are thinking of a different pathway for organic semiconductors,” says Chih-Jen Shih, a chemical engineer at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. Shih and his colleagues were interested in finding a way to fabricate small OLEDs at scale. Using an electron-beam lithography-based technique, they crafted arrays of green OLEDs with pixels as small as 100 nm across.Where today’s best displays have 14,000 pixels per inch, these nanoLEDs—presented in an October 2025 Nature Photonics paper—can reach 100,000 pixels per inch.Another group tried their hands with perovskites, cage-shaped materials best-known for their prowess in high-efficiency solar panels. Perovskites have recently gained traction in LEDs too. “We wanted to see what would happen if we make perovskite LEDs smaller, all the way down to the micrometer and nanometer length-scale,” says Dawei Di, engineer at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China. Di’s group started with comparatively colossal perovskite LED pixels, measuring hundreds of micrometers. Then, they fabricated sequences of smaller and smaller pixels, each tinier than the last. Even after the 1 μm mark, they did not stop: 890 nm, then 440 nm, only bottoming out at 90 nm. These 90 nm red and green pixels, presented in a March 2025 Nature paper, likely represent the smallest LEDs reported to date.Efficiency ChallengesUnfortunately, small size comes at a cost: Shrinking LEDs also shrinks their efficiency. Di’s group’s perovskite nanoLEDs have external quantum efficiencies—a measure of how many injected electrons are converted into photons—around 5 to 10 percent; Shih’s group’s nano-OLED arrays performed slightly better, topping 13 percent. For comparison, a typical millimeter-sized III-V LED can reach 50 to 70 percent, depending on its color.Shih, however, is optimistic that modifying how nano-OLEDs are made can boost their efficiency. “In principle, you can achieve 30 percent, 40 percent external quantum efficiency with OLEDs, even with a smaller pixel, but it takes time to optimize the process,” Shih says.Di thinks that researchers could take perovskite nanoLEDs to less dire efficiencies by tinkering with the material. Although his group is now focusing on the larger perovskite microLEDs, Di expects researchers will eventually reckon with nanoLEDs’ efficiency gap. If applications of smaller LEDs become appealing, “this issue could become increasingly important,” Di says. What Can NanoLEDs Be Used For?What can you actually do with LEDs this small? Today, the push for tinier pixels largely comes from devices like smart glasses and virtual reality headsets. Makers of these displays are hungry for smaller and smaller pixels in a chase for bleeding-edge picture quality with low power consumption (one reason that efficiency is important). Polar Light’s Fajerson says that smart-glass manufacturers today are already seeking 3 μm pixels.But researchers are skeptical that VR displays will ever need pixels smaller than around 1 μm. Shrink pixels too far beyond that, and they’ll cross their light’s diffraction limit—that means they’ll become too small for the human eye to resolve. Shih’s and Di’s groups have already crossed the limit with their 100-nm and 90-nm pixels.Very tiny LEDs may instead find use in on-chip photonics systems, allowing the likes of AI data centers to communicate with greater bandwidths than they can today. Chip manufacturing giant TSMC is already trying out microLED interconnects, and it’s easy to imagine chipmakers turning to even smaller LEDs in the future.But the tiniest nanoLEDs may have even more exotic applications, because they’re smaller than the wavelengths of their light. “From a process point of view, you are making a new component that was not possible in the past,” Shih says.For example, Shih’s group showed their nano-OLEDs could form a metasurface—a structure that uses its pixels’ nano-sizes to control how each pixel interacts with its neighbors. One day, similar devices could focus nanoLED light into laser-like beams or create holographic 3D nanoLED displays.",

        "title": "What the FDA’s 2026 Update Means for Wearables",
        "text": "As new consumer hardware and software capabilities have bumped up against medicine over the last few years, consumers and manufacturers alike have struggled with identifying the line between “wellness” products such as earbuds that can also amplify and clarify surrounding speakers’ voices and regulated medical devices such as conventional hearing aids. On January 6, 2026, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued new guidance documents clarifying how it interprets existing law for the review of wearable and AI-assisted devices. The first document, for general wellness, specifies that the FDA will interpret noninvasive sensors such as sleep trackers or heart rate monitors as low-risk wellness devices while treating invasive devices under conventional regulations. The other document defines how the FDA will exempt clinical decision support tools from medical device regulations, limiting such software to analyzing existing data rather than extracting data from sensors, and requiring them to enable independent review of their recommendations. The documents do not rewrite any statutes, but they refine interpretation of existing law, compared to the 2019 and 2022 documents they replace. They offer a fresh lens on how regulators see technology that sits at the intersection of consumer electronics, software, and medicine—a category many other countries are choosing to regulate more strictly rather than less.What the 2026 update changedThe 2026 FDA update clarifies how it distinguishes between “medical information” and systems that measure physiological “signals” or “patterns.” Earlier guidance discussed these concepts more generally, but the new version defines signal-measuring systems as those that collect continuous, near-continuous, or streaming data from the body for medical purposes, such as home devices transmitting blood pressure, oxygen saturation, or heart rate to clinicians. It gives more concrete examples, like a blood glucose lab result as medical information versus continuous glucose monitor readings as signals or patterns.The updated guidance also sharpens examples of what counts as medical information that software may display, analyze, or print. These include radiology reports or summaries from legally marketed software, ECG reports annotated by clinicians, blood pressure results from cleared devices, and lab results stored in electronic health records. In addition, the 2026 update softens FDA’s earlier stance on clinical decision tools that offer only one recommendation. While prior guidance suggested tools needed to present multiple options to avoid regulation, FDA now indicates that a single recommendation may be acceptable if only one option is clinically appropriate, though it does not define how that determination will be made. Separately, updates to the general wellness guidance clarify that some non-invasive wearables—such as optical sensors estimating blood glucose for wellness or nutrition awareness—may qualify as general wellness products, while more invasive technologies would not.Wellness still requires accuracyFor designers of wearable health devices, the practical implications go well beyond what label you choose. “Calling something ‘wellness’ doesn’t reduce the need for rigorous validation,” says Omer Inan, a medical device technology researcher at the Georgia Tech School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. A wearable that reports blood pressure inaccurately could lead a user to conclude that their values are normal when they are not—potentially influencing decisions about seeking clinical care.“In my opinion, engineers designing devices to deliver health and wellness information to consumers should not change their approach based on this new guidance,” says Inan. Certain measurements—such as blood pressure or glucose—carry real medical consequences regardless of how they’re branded, Inan notes.Unless engineers follow robust validation protocols for technology delivering health and wellness information, Inan says, consumers and clinicians alike face the risk of faulty information.To address that, Inan advocates for transparency: companies should publish their validation results in peer-reviewed journals, and independent third parties without financial ties to the manufacturer should evaluate these systems. That approach, he says, helps the engineering community and the broader public assess the accuracy and reliability of wearable devices.When wellness meets medicineThe societal and clinical impacts of wearables are already visible, regardless of regulatory labels, says Sharona Hoffman, JD, a law and bioethics professor at Case Western Reserve University.Medical metrics from devices like the Apple Watch or Fitbit may be framed as “wellness,” but in practice many users treat them like medical data, influencing their behavior or decisions about care, Hoffman points out.“It could cause anxiety for patients who constantly check their metrics,” she notes. Alternatively, “A person may enter a doctor’s office confident that their wearable has diagnosed their condition, complicating clinical conversations and decision-making.”Moreover, privacy issues remain unresolved, unmentioned in previous or updated guidance documents. Many companies that design wellness devices fall outside protections like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), meaning data about health metrics could be collected, shared, or sold without the same constraints as traditional medical data. “We don’t know what they’re collecting information about or whether marketers will get hold of it,” Hoffman says. International approachesThe European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act designates systems that process health-related data or influence clinical decisions as “high risk,” subjecting them to stringent requirements around data governance, transparency, and human oversight. China and South Korea have also implemented rules that tighten controls on algorithmic systems that intersect with healthcare or public-facing use cases. South Korea provides very specific categories for regulation for technology makers, such as standards on labeling and description on medical devices and good manufacturing practices. Across these regions, regulators are not only classifying technology by its intended use but also by its potential impact on individuals and society at large.“Other countries that emphasize technology are still worrying about data privacy and patients,” Hoffman says. “We’re going in the opposite direction.”Post-market oversight “Regardless of whether something is FDA approved, these technologies will need to be monitored in the sites where they’re used,” says Todd R. Johnson, a professor of biomedical informatics at McWilliams School of Biomedical Informatics at UTHealth Houston, who has worked on FDA-regulated products and informatics in clinical settings. “There’s no way the makers can ensure ahead of time that all of the recommendations will be sound.”Large health systems may have the capacity to audit and monitor tools, but smaller clinics often do not. Monitoring and auditing are not emphasized in the current guidance, raising questions about how reliability and safety will be maintained once devices and software are deployed widely.Balancing innovation and safetyFor engineers and developers, the FDA’s 2026 guidance presents both opportunities and responsibilities. By clarifying what counts as a regulated device, the agency may reduce upfront barriers for some categories of technology. But that shift also places greater weight on design rigor, validation transparency, and post-market scrutiny. “Device makers do care about safety,” Johnson says. “But regulation can increase barriers to entry while also increasing safety and accuracy. There’s a trade-off.”",

        "title": "RFK Jr. promised to restore trust in US health agencies. One year later, it’s eroding",
        "text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump&#x27;s choice to be Secretary of Health and Human Services, appears before the Senate Finance Committee for his confirmation hearing, at the Capitol in Washington, Jan. 29, 2025. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis, file)2026-02-12T15:03:30Z\n                                        NEW YORK (AP) — Since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was sworn in to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services one year ago, he has defended his upending of federal health policy by saying the changes will restore trust in America’s public health agencies.But as the longtime leader of the anti-vaccine movement scales back immunization guidance and dismisses scientists and advisers, he’s clashed with top medical groups who say he’s not following the science.The confrontation is deepening confusion among the public that had already surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys show trust in the agencies Kennedy leads is falling, rather than rising, as the country’s health landscape undergoes dramatic change. Kennedy says he’s aiming to boost transparency to empower Americans to make their own health choices. Doctors counter that the false and unverified information he’s promoting is causing major, perhaps irreversible, damage — and that if enough people forgo vaccination, it will cause a surge of illness and death.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThere was a time when people trusted health agencies regardless of party and the government reported “the best of what science knows at this point,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n“Now, you cannot confidently go to federal websites and know that,” she said.HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon argued that trust had suffered during the Biden administration. “Kennedy’s mandate is to restore transparency, scientific rigor, and accountability,” he said.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nTrust slid during the COVID pandemicHistorically, federal scientific and public health agencies enjoyed strong ratings in public opinion polls. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for decades scored above many other government agencies in Gallup surveys that asked whether they were doing a “good” or “excellent” job. Two decades ago, more than 60% of Americans gave the CDC high marks, according to Gallup. But that number fell dramatically at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, amid agency mistakes and guidance that some people didn’t like. In 2020, the percentage of Americans who believed the CDC was doing at least a “good” job fell to 40% and then leveled off for the next few years.\n    \n        \n    \n\nAlix Ellis, a hairstylist and mom in Madison, Georgia, used to fully trust the CDC and other health agencies but lost that confidence during the COVID-19 pandemic. She said some of the guidance didn’t make sense. At her salon, for example, stylists could work directly on someone’s hair, but others in the room had to be several feet away.“I’m not saying that we were lied to, but that is when I was like, OK, ‘Why are we doing this?’” the 35-year-old said. Kennedy helped create the trust problem, doctor saysPart of Kennedy’s pitch as health secretary has been restoring Americans’ trust in public health.“We’re going to tell them what we know, we’re going to tell them what we don’t know, and we’re going to tell them what we’re researching and how we’re doing it,” Kennedy told senators last September, while explaining how he intended to make the CDC’s information reliable. “It’s the only way to restore trust in the agency — by making it trustworthy.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nBefore entering politics, Kennedy was one of the loudest voices spreading false information about immunizations. Now, he’s trying to fix a trust problem he helped create, said Dr. Rob Davidson, a Michigan emergency physician.“You fed those people false information to create the distrust, and now you’re sweeping into power and you’re going to cure the distrust by promoting the same disinformation,” said Davidson, who runs a doctor group called the Committee to Protect Health Care. “It’s upside-down.”Kennedy has wielded the power of his office to take multiple steps that diverge from medical consensus.Last May, he announced COVID-19 vaccines were no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women, a move doctors called concerning and confusing. In November, he directed the CDC to abandon its position that vaccines do not cause autism, without supplying new evidence. And earlier this year, the CDC under his leadership reduced the number of vaccines recommended for every child, a decision medical groups said would undermine protections against a half-dozen diseases. Kennedy also has overhauled his department through canceled grants and mass layoffs. Last summer, Kennedy fired his new CDC chief after less than a month over disagreements about vaccine policy.\n    \n        \n    \n\nConfusion emerges as trust erodesSome have applauded the moves. But surveys suggest many Americans have had the opposite reaction.“I have much less trust,” said Mark Rasmussen, a 67-year-old retiree walking into a mall in Danbury, Connecticut, one recent morning.Shocked by Kennedy’s dismantling of public health norms, professional medical groups have urged Americans not to follow new vaccine recommendations they say were adopted without public input or compelling evidence.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, along with more than 200 public health and advocacy groups, urged Congress to investigate how and why Kennedy changed the vaccine schedule. The American Medical Association, working with the University of Minnesota’s Vaccine Integrity Project, this week announced a new evidence-based process for reviewing the safety of respiratory virus vaccines — something they say is needed since the government stopped doing that kind of systematic review.Many Democratic-led states also have rebuffed Kennedy’s policies, even creating their own alliances to counter his vaccine guidance.“We see burgeoning confusion about which sources to trust and about which sources are real. That makes decision-making on an individual level much harder,” said Dr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health. She said she worried the confusion was contributing to the recent rise in diseases like whooping cough and measles, which were once largely eliminated in the U.S. Surveys indicate growing public wavering over support for the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Although a large majority of people support giving it to children, the proportion declined significantly in just over nine months, according to Annenberg research. An August 2025 survey finds that 82% would be “very” or “somewhat” likely to recommend that an eligible child in their household get MMR vaccine, compared with 90% in November 2024.Surveys show trust is declining againNew findings from the health care research nonprofit KFF in January show that 47% of Americans trust the CDC “a great deal” or “a fair amount” to provide reliable vaccine information, down about 10 percentage points since the beginning of Trump’s second term.Trust among Democrats dropped 9 percentage points since September, to 55%, the survey found. Trust among Republicans and independents hasn’t changed since September, but it has declined somewhat among both groups since the beginning of Trump’s term.Even among MAHA supporters, the poll shows, fewer than half say they trust agencies like the CDC and FDA “a lot” or “some” to make recommendations about childhood vaccine schedules.Gallup surveys also show a drop in Americans who believe the CDC is doing a “good job,” from 40% in 2024 to 31% last year.Those results came alongside a decline of trust across the government — not just agencies under Kennedy’s oversight. Yet concerns about Kennedy’s trustworthiness also have emerged in the past year. Documents recently obtained by The Associated Press and The Guardian, for example, undermine his statements that a 2019 trip to Samoa ahead of a measles outbreak had “nothing to do with vaccines.” The documents have prompted senators to assert that Kennedy lied to them over the visit.HHS officials say they are promoting independent decision-making by families while working to reduce preventable diseases. They say reducing routine vaccine recommendations was meant to ensure parents vaccinate children against the riskiest diseases.HHS did not make Kennedy available for an interview, despite repeated requests. But as he has pledged to restore trust, he’s also urged people to come to their own conclusions.“This idea that you should trust the experts,” Kennedy said recently on The Katie Miller Podcast, “a good mother doesn’t do that.”___AP writer Amelia Thomson DeVeaux in Washington contributed to this report.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The lyrics touch on his rapid ascent, referencing his transition from \"flights of stairs\" to arriving \"somewhere tropical,\" while navigating the juxtaposition of street politics and global fame.The accompanying music video, directed by Don Prod, leans into a distinct aesthetic. Filmed in part at The Mildmay Club in London, the visual captures Cench and his crew in what is described as a \"Peaky Blinders style cinematic performance,\" complete with live strings and tailored fits. Notably, Central Cee’s styling in the video deliberately references the outfit he wore during the original stream for his Drake collaboration, \"Which One?\"This release lands just ahead of another major milestone for the rapper. His highly anticipated SYNA\"&gt;SYNA x Nike collaboration is scheduled to go on sale this Friday, February 13, further expanding his influence beyond music. \"Iceman Freestyle\" is available now on all major streaming platforms. The SYNA x Nike collection drops tomorrow, February 13.Read more at Hypebeast",

Saber Interactive is collaborating directly with franchise director Chad Stahelski to ensure the gameplay mechanics faithfully translate the series' signature \"gun-fu\" combat. The studio promises a system that integrates \"intense driving experiences\" and \"cinematic camerawork\" designed to blur the line between film and gameplay.Narratively, the game will not retread the movies. Instead, it offers a canon prequel story set prior to the \"Impossible Task\"—the legendary mission that originally allowed Wick to retire from the High Table. This timeline allows the developers to explore the criminal underworld at the height of Wick's prime. Alongside familiar faces from the lore, the game will introduce a new cast of characters tailored specifically for this release.The title is currently in development for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. No official release date or pricing has been set. The game is currently available to wishlist on digital storefronts.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "SummaryPromotional posters spotted in Toronto display Drake’s October’s Very Own owl logo alongside McDonald’s brandingThe advertisements feature the tagline “Where Night Owls Land” and point to a February 17 release dateSpeculation suggests the partnership could include a “Famous Orders” celebrity meal, custom packaging, and potentially exclusive merchandiseDrake’s October’s Very Own (OVO) appears set to join the ranks of Travis Scott and J Balvin with a major McDonald’s collaboration. Promotional posters have surfaced across the rapper's hometown of Toronto, featuring the iconic OVO owl logo paired with the Golden Arches. The cryptic signage, first circulated by social media accounts like Kurrco, carries the tagline “Where Night Owls Land” and explicitly dates the project for a February 17 launch.While neither OVO nor McDonald’s has officially detailed the contents of the drop, industry chatter points toward a multi-faceted release. The most prominent theory suggests a new entry in the fast-food giant’s “Famous Orders” campaign, which would align Drake with previous collaborators like BTS and Cardi B. Leaked imagery circulating on Reddit hints at potential staff uniforms, including hoodies, and custom black-and-gold packaging that integrates OVO’s premium aesthetic with McDonald’s mass-market appeal.Further rumors indicate the possibility of a menu-specific item, with some fans dubbing it the “Certified Lover Meal” and others speculating about a purple-hued “Nite Sprite.” Given OVO’s history of high-profile partnerships with brands like Jordan and Canada Goose, a merchandise component is highly anticipated. If the rollout mirrors the Travis Scott playbook, expect a range of apparel and accessories that could drive significant secondary market interest.Currently, the campaign appears to be focused on the Canadian market, specifically Toronto, though a wider rollout remains unconfirmed. The OVO x McDonald’s collaboration is slated to debut on February 17. Fans should monitor OVO and McDonald’s Canada channels for official confirmation on availability and specific product details.&nbsp;View this post on Instagram&nbsp;A post shared by McDonald’s 🇨🇦 (@mcdonaldscanada)Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

Premium suede panels flow from light to dark grey, integrated with a subtle subway-tile texture that nods to Kith's New York roots without over-branding the silhouette. Kith wordmarks are debossed into the grey layers, providing a tactile element that rewards close inspection.Vibrant neon accents appear sparingly throughout the design, reinforcing the inspiration rather than overpowering it. The tongue features a custom oval badge that merges Durant's initials with the classic Air Max logo, while the insole displays co-branded graphics to complete the crossover. This project follows a similar thematic path as Fieg's previous Air Pippen 1 \"Neon\" concept, positioning the shoe as a carefully curated archive piece rather than a mass-market product.The Kith x Nike KD 18 \"Air Max 95\" is strictly a Friends &amp; Family exclusive.

        "text": "AAPE BY A BATHING APE® is doubling down on its \"style without boundaries\" ethos for Spring/Summer 2026, delivering a two-pronged collection that masterfully navigates the space between serene urbanism and the electric energy of rising competitive sports.The seasonal narrative begins in Seoul with AAPENOW, the brand's sub-line that continues to elevate daily essentials. Shot against the rustic, light-drenched backdrop of a traditional Korean tea house, the campaign highlights a shift toward refined minimalism. The palette is a curated wash of soft pastels—pink, blue, green, and yellow—applied to textured cotton blends that offer visual depth while maintaining a lively spring vibe. Key silhouettes include cropped-fit polos and tees, alongside statement wide-leg denim and striped shirts that signal a new \"street attitude\".While the apparel remains grounded in heritage, the details are purely forward-thinking. The iconic Moonface logo receives a playful remix via transparent badges and poker-inspired heart and spade designs. On the technical front, AAPE integrates 3M Scotchgard™ water-repellent coatings and UPF40+ sun protection into its lightweight jackets, ensuring the collection is as functional as it is aesthetic.Simultaneously, AAPE is making a historic play for the center stage of the athletic world with the debut of its PICKLEBALL Collection. Recognizing pickleball as a global lifestyle phenomenon, the brand has engineered a capsule that fuses streetwear ease with high-intensity performance. The aesthetic is punchy and raw, anchored by a vibrant blue-and-green palette and the bold \"AAPE UNION\" graphic.This performance-led range doesn't skimp on utility. Pieces like the half-zip jackets and cargo track pants utilize Teflon® coating for superior water and oil resistance, while Cool Touch fabrics provide instant moisture-wicking and quick-dry properties for peak-performance play. Rounding out the drop is a set of AAPE-branded paddles and court accessories, proving that the Moonface can dominate the court just as easily as the street.The AAPENOW SS26 collection is available now, with the AAPE PICKLEBALL Collection slated to drop from February 13, 2026, at flagship as well as AAPE.com.AAPE STOREHong KongB225B Times Square, Causeway Bay, Hong KongShanghaiLG2, iapm, Xuhui District, ShanghaiJapan 2 Chome-10-2 Nishishinsaibashi, Chuo Ward, OsakaClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

Arriving on the heels of the brand's January 2026 debut, this latest iteration shifts the aesthetic toward a sleek, uniform finish, reimagining the silhouette's decades of cultural versatility through a darker lens.The sneaker is defined by its material execution, utilizing high-gloss black patent leather to coat the upper. While the color palette is monochromatic, texture plays a central role; a cracked, web-like embossing ripples across the surface, adding depth to the otherwise mirror-like shell toe. Tonal black serrated stripes are positioned slightly forward on the side panel, maintaining the subtly altered profile established in previous drops.Detailing remains understated but deliberate, rewarding close inspection. The number \"555\" appears embroidered on the padded tongue and is mirrored on the insole. Beneath the foot, a translucent outsole reveals additional Sp5der branding alongside the recurring numeric motif, quietly tying the collaborative story together without overpowering the classic Superstar DNA. The Sp5der x adidas Superstar \"Black\" is scheduled to release later this year.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

This Spring/Summer 2026 capsule marks the latest partnership between the two entities, fusing Gomis’ Pan-African vision with the Japanese label’s avant-garde shirting.The collection consists of five distinctive shirts that reinterpret the classic CDG SHIRT silhouette through a diasporic lens. Drawing on Gomis’ West African roots and Rastafarian culture, the designs incorporate a vibrant palette of red, gold, and earthy greens. Standout pieces include a shirt embossed with the \"Lion of Judah\" to symbolize strength and courage, and another featuring a speaker illustration that nods to the studio's musical arm, the Jah Jah Sound System.Construction details remain true to Rei Kawakubo’s playful design language while integrating specific cultural codes. One short-sleeve top features plaid patchwork lettering reading \"CDG Shirt JAH,\" while another design is defined by oversized, plaid green sleeves. A particularly complex striped piece features \"bursts\" of plaid fabric arranged like blooming flowers, unfurling directly from the garment's structure. The Jah Jah x COMME des GARÇONS SHIRT collection is now available exclusively at Dover Street Market Paris, New York and Los Angeles.&nbsp;View this post on Instagram&nbsp;A post shared by JJSP (@jahjahstudioparis)Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "Nuclear DNA is surrounded by transcriptional machinery, protein structures that will attempt to transcribe any gene sequence they encounter. Where DNA is compacted into regions of heterochromatin by being spooled onto histones, genes are silenced because their sequences are hidden from transcriptional machinery. Whether a given stretch of DNA is compacted or not is determined by epigenetic mechanisms, largely decorations (such as methyl groups) attached to DNA and histones that alter their structural behavior. A general feature of aging is a loss of heterochromatin and increasing expression of genes and other sequences that are usually silenced in youth. This leads to, for example, the expression of transposons that can drive DNA damage and inflammation, but also disruption and change in normal cell function. Some time [&#8230;]",

That the pattern of DNA methylation changes with age in characteristic ways is what allows the existence of epigenetic clocks, the use of DNA methylation status to assess biological age. That epigenetic control over gene expression changes with age also makes it a potential target for the development of therapies to treat aging, particularly now that partial reprogramming studies have amply demonstrated that reversing age-related epigenetic changes is possible in principle.

        "text": "Rapamycin is the most well studied of the mTOR inhibitors. It produces immunosuppression at high doses, and has been used in this context in the clinic for more than twenty years. At lower doses it mimics aspects of the beneficial metabolic response to calorie restriction, om particular an increased operation of the cellular maintenance processes of autophagy. In animal studies this has been demonstrated to slow aging and extend healthy life. Human clinical trial data for this lower dose anti-aging usage remains relatively sparse, unfortunately, but the results that do exist are interesting. Rapamycin is one of the most intensively studied compounds with potential effects on longevity. Available experimental data indicate that inhibition of the mTOR pathway and activation of autophagy lead to improved cellular [&#8230;]",
