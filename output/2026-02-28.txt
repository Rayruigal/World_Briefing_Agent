Armed Conflict & Security
• Israel launched “pre-emptive” air strikes on Iran as cross-border tensions with Hezbollah in Lebanon persisted, with daily violations reported.
• Pakistan-Afghanistan hostilities escalated; Islamabad described an “open war” with the Taliban government after strikes, while the US backed Pakistan’s right to self-defense.
• A Bolivian Air Force plane carrying banknotes crashed near La Paz, killing at least 15–20 people and triggering chaotic scenes as crowds rushed the scattered cash.
• A US military anti-drone laser mistakenly shot down a Customs and Border Protection drone near the Texas border, prompting an FAA airspace closure.
• The Pentagon’s standoff with Anthropic over military AI use deepened, with Trump ordering agencies to stop using its tech and the company preparing a legal challenge.
Why it matters: Rapid escalations across multiple theaters—from the Middle East to South Asia—combined with emerging tech mishaps and AI policy clashes are testing crisis management and governance.

Artificial Intelligence
• Trump ordered all US agencies to cease using Anthropic’s AI, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth labeled the firm a “supply chain risk” amid a dispute over “any lawful use” provisions.
• Anthropic plans to sue, arguing the Pentagon’s blacklisting is legally unsound; tech workers at Google and OpenAI voiced support for Anthropic’s red lines on mass surveillance and autonomous lethal weapons.
• OpenAI struck a deal with the Pentagon hours after Anthropic was blacklisted, and announced $110 billion in new investments (Amazon $50B, Nvidia and SoftBank $30B each) while reporting 900M weekly users.
• Media and analysts warn of risks in military AI governance, surveillance, and autonomous weapons as labs and policymakers draw lines in real time.
Why it matters: The confrontation is defining who sets the rules for military AI—and how commercial models can be constrained—while reshaping funding, partnerships, and public trust.

Geopolitics & Diplomacy
• Iran nuclear diplomacy sent mixed signals: Oman’s FM said “peace within reach” with no stockpiles, while the IAEA said it can’t verify Iran suspended enrichment; US and UK moved to pull diplomats amid war fears.
• The US Embassy in Israel advised staff they could leave as tensions rose; Trump said he’s “not happy” with nuclear talks but will allow more time, and floated a “friendly takeover of Cuba” without details.
• Denmark warned of likely Russian interference in its March election, citing new fault lines and disinformation risks.
• The Anthropic-Pentagon clash spilled into policy, with supply-chain risk designations and tech employees’ open letters highlighting governance of AI in national security.
Why it matters: Conflicting signals on Iran, heightened regional risks, and foreign election interference concerns underscore a volatile diplomatic landscape with tech policy implications.
