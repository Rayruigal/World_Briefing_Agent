        "text": "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres attends the opening of the 61st session of the United Nations Human Rights Council at the European headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva, Monday, Feb. 23, 2026. (Valentin Flauraud/Keystone via AP)2026-02-28T21:27:13Z\n                                        UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations chief condemned the U.S.-Israeli airstrikes on Iran and called for an immediate return to negotiations “to pull the region, and our world, back from the brink.”Secretary-General António Guterres told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Saturday that everything must be done to prevent further escalation. “The alternative,” he warned, “is a potential wider conflict with grave consequences for civilians and regional stability.”Guterres also condemned Iran’s retaliatory attacks for violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon, speaking to reporters before the meeting, said it was “hypocrisy” to condemn the airstrikes. He said Iran is responsible for the actions of its proxies in the Middle East and for its nuclear and missile programs, and Israel and the U.S. acted “to prevent an irreversible and immediate threat.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe attack on Iran killed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, The Associated Press has reported. The assassination of the second leader of the Islamic Republic, who had no designated successor, raised the prospects of a protracted conflict given Iranian threats of retaliation. President Donald Trump on social media called his passing “the single greatest chance for the Iranian people to take back their Country.”\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, in a letter to the secretary-general, accused the United States and Israel of “flagrantly” violating Iran’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and the U.N. Charter. He said Iran was exercising its right to self-defense under the charter in response.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nHe urged the council members “to take the necessary and immediate measures to halt this unlawful use of force and to ensure accountability.” And he called for an unequivocal condemnation of “this act of aggression … as it undoubtedly poses an unprecedented threat to regional as well as global peace and security.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nFive council members — Bahrain, which is the Arab representative on the council, France, Russia, China and Colombia — called for the emergency meeting.In a joint statement, the leaders of Britain and France — both veto-wielding members of the council — along with Germany’s chancellor called for a resumption of U.S.-Iranian talks on Tehran’s nuclear program. The three countries, part of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, have led efforts to reach a negotiated solution. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal in 2018.The three European leaders strongly condemned Iranian airstrikes in the region — not the U.S.-Israeli airstrikes — and urged Iran’s leaders to seek a negotiated solution, saying: “Ultimately, the Iranian people must be allowed to determine their future.”The Security Council meeting is taking place on the last day of the United Kingdom’s presidency and a day before the United States takes over the rotating presidency for the month of March.",

(AP Photo/Rahmat Gul)2026-02-28T18:57:48Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — Key members of Congress are demanding a swift vote on a war powers resolution that would restrain President Donald Trump’s military attack on Iran unless the administration wins their approval for what they warn is a potentially illegal campaign that risks pulling the United States into a deeper Middle East conflict.Both the House and Senate, where the president’s Republican Party has a slim majority, had already drafted such resolutions long before the strikes Saturday. Now they are ready to plunge into a rare war powers debate next week that will serve as a referendum on Trump’s decision to go it alone on military action without formal authorization from Congress. “Has President Trump learned nothing from decades of U.S. meddling in Iran and forever wars in the Middle East?” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., a leader in the bipartisan effort. He said the strikes on Iran were “a colossal mistake.” \n    \n        \n    \n\nIn the House, Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., are demanding Congress go on record with a public vote on their own bipartisan measure. “Congress must convene on Monday to vote,” Khanna said, “to stop this.” \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nMassie blasted Trump’s own presidential campaign slogan and said: “This is not ‘America First.’”But most Republicans, particularly their leaders, welcomed Trump’s move against Iran. Many cited the longtime U.S. adversary’s nuclear programs and missile capabilities as requiring a military response. “Well done, Mr. President,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. “As I watch and monitor this historic operation, I’m in awe of President Trump’s determination to be a man of peace but at the end of the day, evil’s worst nightmare.”\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nWar powers debate tests CongressThe administration’s decision to launch, with Israel, what appears to be an open-ended joint military operation aimed at changing the government in Tehran is testing the Constitution’s separation of powers in deep and dramatic ways. Nearly two months earlier, Trump ordered U.S. strikes that toppled Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.While presidents have the authority as the commander in chief to conduct certain strategic military operations on their own, the Constitution vests Congress with the power to wage war. Before the Iraq War began in March 2003, Republican President George W. Bush made a monthslong push to secure congressional authorization. No such vote was attempted on Iran, and an earlier Senate effort to halt Trump’s actions after last summer’s strike on Iran failed.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe congressional debate over war powers would mostly be symbolic. Even if a resolution were to pass the narrowly split Congress, Trump likely would veto it and Congress would not have the two-thirds majority needed to overturn that rejection. Congress has often failed to block other U.S. military actions, including in a Senate vote on Venezuela, but the roll calls stand as a public record.\n    \n        \n    \n\nRepublican leaders back Trump’s actionThe response by House Speaker Mike Johnson reflected the party’s long-standing views. Iran, he said, is facing “the severe consequences of its evil actions.”Johnson, R-La., said the leaders of the House and Senate and the respective intelligence committees had been briefed in detail earlier in the week that military action “may become necessary” to protect U.S. troops and citizens in Iran. He said he received updates from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and will stay in “close contact” with Trump and the Defense Department “as this operation proceeds.”Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., commended Trump “for taking action to thwart these threats.”Thune said he looked forward to administration officials briefing all senators — a signal that lawmakers are seeking more answers to their questions about Trump’s plans ahead.\n    \n        \n    \n\nDemocrats warn strikes are illegalMany Democrats are calling the operation illegal, saying the Constitution gives Congress alone the power to declare war. To them, the administration has failed to lay out its rationale or plan for the military strikes, and the aftermath.Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the president has undertaken “illegal, regime-change war against Iran.”“This is not making us safer &amp; only damages the US &amp; our interests,” Van Hollen, D-Md., said in a social media post. “The Senate must immediately vote on the War Powers Resolution to stop it.”House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said while Iran is a “bad actor and must be aggressively confronted” for its human rights abuses and the threat it poses to the U.S. and allies, the administration “must seek authorization for the preemptive use of military force that constitutes an act of war.”New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, demanded that Congress be briefed immediately on the administration’s plans. “Iran must never be allowed to attain a nuclear weapon but the American people do not want another endless and costly war in the Middle East when there are so many problems at home,” he said.___Associated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick and Matt Brown contributed to this report.",

        "title": "World leaders react cautiously to US and Israeli strikes on Iran as fears grow of a wider war",
        "text": "EU High Representative Kaja Kallas visits the coast guard ship KV Bjornoya, in Tromso, Norway, Tuesday Feb. 3, 2026. (Rune Stoltz Bertinussen/NTB Scanpix via AP)2026-02-28T11:12:29Z\n                                        BRUSSELS (AP) — World leaders reacted warily to U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran on Saturday that triggered concerns of a broader conflict. European leaders held emergency meetings and took measures to protect their citizens in the Middle East, with key leaders calling for a negotiated settlement between Iran and the U.S. Australia and Canada were more open in their support for the strikes, while Russia and China responded with criticism. Britain, France and Germany called for a resumption of U.S.-Iran nuclear negotiations and condemned Iranian attacks on countries in the region. They did not directly comment on the U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in a statement their countries didn’t take part in the strikes on Iran but are in close contact with the U.S., Israel and partners in the region.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe three countries have led efforts to reach a negotiated solution over Iran’s nuclear program.“We condemn Iranian attacks on countries in the region in the strongest terms. Iran must refrain from indiscriminate military strikes. We call for a resumption of negotiations and urge the Iranian leadership to seek a negotiated solution. Ultimately, the Iranian people must be allowed to determine their future,” they said.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe strikes on Iran create a dilemma for Washington’s allies. While European leaders firmly oppose Iran’s nuclear program and crackdowns by its hard-line theocracy, they are loath to embrace unilateral military action by President Donald Trump that could breach international law and unleash a broader conflict.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nTrump’s strikes on Iran last June, and the arrest of Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro last month, caused a similar quandary.Russia’s Foreign Ministry called the strikes “a pre-planned and unprovoked act of armed aggression against a sovereign and independent U.N. member state.” The ministry accused Washington and Tel Aviv of “hiding behind” concerns about Iran’s nuclear program while actually pursuing regime change.China’s government said it was “highly concerned” about the U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran and called for an immediate halt to the military action and a return to negotiations. “Iran’s sovereignty, security and territorial integrity should be respected,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said.\n    \n        \n    \n\nConcern of ‘new, extensive’ warIt was unclear whether U.S. allies were given any advance warning of the attacks. The German government said it was only given notice Saturday morning. France’s junior defense minister said France knew something would happen, but didn’t know when.Earlier on Saturday, French President Emmanuel Macron called for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting in response to the strikes in Iran.“The outbreak of war among the United States, Israel and Iran has serious consequences for peace and international security,″ Macron said earlier on Saturday. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer chaired a meeting of the government’s emergency committee on Saturday morning. “We do not want to see further escalation into a wider regional conflict,” a U.K. government spokesperson said.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe German government’s crisis management team also was also due to meet on Saturday. “NATO is closely following developments in Iran and the region,” NATO spokesperson Allison Hart said. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his country supports the U.S. in its effort to stop Iran from obtaining an atomic bomb. He described Iran’s current leadership as a destabilizing force and noted two attacks on Australian soil that were blamed on Tehran. Australia in August cut off diplomatic relations with Iran and expelled its ambassador after accusing it of orchestrating two antisemitic attacks in the country. Canada too, despite recent tensions with the U.S., expressed its support for the military action. “The Islamic Republic of Iran is the principal source of instability and terror throughout the Middle East,” Prime Minister Mark Carney said. \n    \n        \n    \n\nEU urges diplomacy Responding to the attack, the European Union’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas called the conflict in the Middle East “perilous” and said she was working with Israeli and Arab officials to pursue a negotiated peace.EU leaders issued a joint statement Saturday calling for restraint and engaging in regional diplomacy in hopes of “ensuring nuclear safety.”“We call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint, to protect civilians, and to fully respect international law,” said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa.Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that he was concerned the failure of negotiations between the U.S. and Iran meant a “new, extensive war in the Middle East” would happen. \n    \n        \n    \n\n‘Totally irresponsible’The Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons condemned the U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran in harsher words. “These attacks are totally irresponsible and risk provoking further escalation as well as increasing the danger of nuclear proliferation and the use of nuclear weapons,” said its executive director, Melissa Parke. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim condemned Israeli strikes on Iran and accompanying U.S. military action, warning that the escalating conflict has pushed the Middle East to the “edge of catastrophe.”Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday condemned what he described as “unwarranted attacks” on Iran during a phone call with his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi.___Ciobanu reported from Warsaw.

        "title": "Trump was once wary of ordering regime change in Iran. Here’s what made him change his mind",
        "text": "President Donald Trump holds up a fist after disembarking Air Force One at Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach, Fla., Friday, Feb. 27, 2026. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)2026-03-01T00:20:38Z\n                                        WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — With Saturday’s military operation against Iran, President Donald Trump demonstrated a dramatic evolution in risk tolerance, adjusting in just a matter of months how far he was willing to go in using American military might to confront Tehran’s clerical rule.Guardrails were tossed aside, as Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered up a battle plan that included targeted strikes on Iran’s leadership, including the 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei whose death Trump triumphantly announced in a social media post hours after launching the military operation.For Trump, it was a far cry from where he stood just eight months ago. At Israel’s urging during its 12-day war with Iran last June, he agreed to deployB-2 bombers to pummel three key Iranian nuclear sites — but drew a bright red line when Israelis presented his administration with a plan for killing Khamenei.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe president peppered the supreme leader with thinly veiled threats back in June that he could have killed him if he wanted to. But he rejected the Israeli plan out of concern that it would destabilize the region.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThat caution was set aside on Saturday with Trump announcing Khamenei had been killed, while the Israeli military announced it had taken out Iran’s defense minister and the commander of its Revolutionary Guard. Iran had not confirmed the Supreme Leader’s death as of Saturday evening.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nKhamenei “was unable to avoid our Intelligence and Highly Sophisticated Tracking Systems and, working closely with Israel, there was not a thing he, or the other leaders that have been killed along with him, could do,” Trump said. “This is the single greatest chance for the Iranian people to take back their Country.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nTrump loses patienceTrump had pursued talks with Iran for months. Administration officials told reporters that they offered Iran many ways to have a peaceful nuclear program that could be used for civilian purposes, including an offer of free nuclear fuel in perpetuity.But the officials, who were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was clear to them that Iran wanted enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon. One of them said that Iran has met their offers with “games, tricks, stall tactics.”The order to launch strikes came just two days after Trump dispatched his special envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, for another round of talks with Iranian officials. Middle East and European allies were urging the U.S. administration to give negotiations more time as Trump signaled he was running out of patience. “The consequences are likely to be as far-reaching as they are uncertain: Within the system that has held power for nearly five decades, between the government and a dissatisfied populace, and between Iran and its adversaries,” said Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. “And although the regime is weakened, a sense that this showdown is an all-or-nothing struggle for its very survival could lead it to respond with every tool still at its disposal.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nRevised risk calculationSaturday’s strikes came after a series of past provocative actions against Iran that resulted in limited blowback, which seemed to inform Trump’s risk calculation, said Aaron David Miller, who served as an adviser on Middle East issues to Democratic and Republican administrations over two decades.Trump in 2018 pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration. In 2020, Trump ordered a drone strike killing top Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.At the time, the killing of Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, was arguably the most provocative U.S. military action in the Middle East since President George W. Bush launched the 2003 Iraq War to topple Saddam Hussein.And then Trump this past June ordered the strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, which he claimed had “obliterated” their program.“He did all of these things without cost or consequence to him,” said Miller, who is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “He’s been risk-ready. That’s the nature of his personality.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nTrump administration officials had publicly urged Tehran to give up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs and end its backing of regional armed proxies. But administration officials said that Tehran would not engage on the missile and proxy concerns.Iran’s rigidity, at a moment when its economy is in shambles weighed by decades of sanctions and its military battered by last year’s war, astounded Trump.Even before the latest round of talks ended on Thursday, there were signs Trump was leaning toward military action.On Tuesday, Trump in his State of the Union speech claimed that Iran has been building ballistic missiles that could reach the U.S. homeland — a justification that he repeated again on Saturday as he announced the bombardment of Iran was underway. \n    \n        \n    \n\nIran hasn’t acknowledged it is building or seeking to build intercontinental ballistic missiles. The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, however, said in an unclassified report last year that Iran could develop a militarily viable intercontinental ballistic missile by 2035 “should Tehran decide to pursue the capability.”Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Wednesday that Iran’s refusal to speak to its ballistic missile program was a “big problem.” Rubio declined to address the DIA finding that Iran was still years away from developing a missile that could reach the United States.And Vice President JD Vance, a former U.S. Marine who served in Iraq and has been skeptical of U.S. interventions, on Thursday told The Washington Post that Trump hadn’t decided whether to strike Iran. But he offered assurances that military action would not result in the United States becoming involved in a drawn-out conflict.“The idea that we’re going to be in a Middle Eastern war for years with no end in sight — there is no chance that will happen,” Vance said.By Friday, Trump was venting anew about Iran’s approach. “ I’m not happy with the fact that they’re not willing to give us what we have to have,” Trump said. “I’m not thrilled with that. We’ll see what happens.”Senior U.S. lawmakers were told early Saturday that the strikes were coming. Trump monitored the operation from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, with members of his national security team.Trump may have been emboldened by his Venezuela experienceTrump’s success with the U.S. military operation earlier his year to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and whisk him and his wife to New York City to face federal drug conspiracy charges also may have emboldened the president, said Jonathan Schanzer, a former Treasury Department official who is now executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a hawkish Washington think tank.Trump had threatened military action last month, but held off, as Iran carried out a deadly crackdown on protests. The demonstrations were spurred by economic grievances but morphed into a nationwide, anti-government push against the ruling clerics. As human rights groups reported that thousands were killed in the Iranian crackdown, Trump told protesters that help was on its way, but it did not immediately come and the protests petered out.Schanzer said that Trump’s decision not to follow through last month gave his team more time to assemble the now massive presence of fighter jets and warships in the region — as he had done in the Caribbean ahead of the Venezuela operation.It was leverage, Trump hoped, that would get Khamenei to blink. But the Supreme Leader would not capitulate.“The way this unfolded was inevitable, because there was no way that the Ayatollah was going to show flexibility,” Schanzer said.___Madhani reported from Washington.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                AAMER MADHANI\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Madhani covers the White House for The Associated Press.

        "title": "Trump’s ‘America First’ campaign battle cry gives way to military strikes abroad",
        "text": "President Donald Trump leaves the stage after speaking at the Port of Corpus Christi in Corpus Christi, Texas, Friday, Feb. 27, 2026. (AP Photo/Michael Gonzalez)2026-02-28T22:41:51Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump, whose fierce denunciation of military adventurism abroad fueled his unlikely rise to the top of the Republican Party, risks becoming ensnared by that very type of conflict. The U.S. and Israeli attack on Iran Saturday cemented Trump’s decade-long transformation from a candidate who in 2016 called the Iraq War a “big, fat mistake” to a president warning Americans to prepare for potential casualties overseas and encouraging Iranians to “seize control of your destiny.” The strikes were also at odds with Trump’s warnings during the 2024 campaign that his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, was surrounded by “war hawks” eager to send troops overseas. Trump justified the action as necessary to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons or developing missiles capable of reaching the US, less than a year after he said airstrikes “obliterated” their capability. US intelligence has also said Iran’s weapons capability was substantially degraded. \n    \n        \n    \n\nFor Trump, memories of the false pretenses underlying the Iraq War could lead to pressure to prove his assertion that Iran’s weapons production posed an imminent threat to Americans. And for Republicans already facing a challenging election year weighed down by economic anxiety, the shift could force a reassessment of how the attacks fit into the “America First,” isolationist-leaning movement the party has embraced during the Trump era.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nWhile Trump might benefit from an early rally-around-the-flag effect, that could be hard to sustain for weeks and months, if not longer, a far different scenario from the swift effort to remove Nicolás Maduro from power earlier this year in Venezuela.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nSuccess on day one is one thing. The days after are inherently unpredictable. “The question is whether Iran’s goal is simply to outlast America and whether Trump has strategic attention deficit disorder, which will allow the Iranians to rise from the ashes and claim victory,” said Michael Rubin, a historian at the American Enterprise Institute who worked as a staff adviser on Iran and Iraq at the Pentagon from 2002 to 2004. \n    \n        \n    \n\nMany Republicans get behind TrumpMany Republicans were quick to line up behind the president, including Texas Sen. John Cornyn and state attorney general Ken Paxton, who are fighting a competitive Senate primary election on Tuesday. “Hopefully lives will not be lost needlessly, but this always entails risk,” Cornyn said Saturday at a campaign stop near Houston. “But we know that Iran will not stop unless the United States and our allies stop them.”Others, like Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, praised the military and were critical of Iran while noting that Americans will have questions that “must be answered.” And there was outright opposition from some who have long criticized overseas entanglements, including Sen. Rand Paul, the Republican of Kentucky, who lamented the start of “another preemptive war.” Former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican who was once a close Trump ally, rejected the president’s warning of Iran’s nuclear capabilities.“It’s always a lie and it’s always America Last,” she wrote online. “But it feels like the worst betrayal this time because it comes from the very man and the admin who we all believed was different.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nLittle advance preparation for AmericansThe administration did little in advance to prepare Americans for such a dramatic action. Vice President JD Vance told The Washington Post this week there was “no chance” that the U.S. would become involved in a drawn-out war as it did in Iraq. During his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, Trump dedicated just a few lines to Iran, arguing the country and its proxies have “spread nothing but terrorism, death and hate.”That stands in stark contrast to the lengthy runup to the Iraq War. President George W. Bush, for example, named Iraq as a member of the so-called axis of evil in January 2002. Then-Secretary of State Colin Powell delivered a now-infamous speech to the United Nations in February 2003, making the case for war based on the inaccurate assertion that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. The invasion, which ultimately dominated Bush’s second term, didn’t begin until March 2003. \n    \n        \n    \n\n“We just have to be honest that there is a sense that this was not sold to the American public sufficiently,” Andrew Kolvet said Saturday on “The Charlie Kirk Show,” an online program founded by the late conservative activist who was close to Trump. “Perhaps there will be an opportunity on the backend of this.”Kolvet was willing, however, to give Trump leeway, noting these are the types of challenging decisions presidents are entrusted with.“President Trump has earned a big, long leash,” he said. “Not an unlimited one. But a very long one to make tough decisions.”Polling suggests that many Americans share Trump’s concerns about Iran’s nuclear capabilities, even if they’re less confident in the president’s response. About half of U.S. adults were “extremely” or “very” concerned that Iran’s nuclear program poses a direct threat to the U.S., according to a poll this month from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. \n    \n        \n    \n\nMost Americans, 61%, said Iran is an “enemy” of the U.S., which is up slightly from a Pearson Institute/AP-NORC poll conducted in September 2023. But their confidence in the president’s judgment when it comes to relationships with adversaries and the use of military force abroad is low, the new poll shows, with only about 3 in 10 Americans saying they have “a great deal” or “quite a bit” of trust in Trump.Democrats sense an openingDemocrats sense a political opening on the issue. In Maine, Gov. Janet Mills and Graham Platner are competing for the Democratic nomination to challenge incumbent Sen. Susan Collins in the fall. They both issued statements on Saturday pressing Collins, the only Republican on the ballot this year in a state won by Harris, to step up her oversight of the administration.Collins was one of three Senate Republicans who backed an unsuccessful push last month for a war powers resolution that would have limited Trump’s ability to conduct further attacks on Venezuela. Democrats said Saturday they would quickly seek a vote on a similar proposal for Iran. “If we’ve started a war where we begin to lose American lives, that starts changing the political calculus,” said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean.But he noted that Democrats have vulnerabilities of their own, particularly if there’s a domestic terror attack while the Department of Homeland Security is closed as they demand changes to how immigration operations are conducted.For now, Trump isn’t offering much of a detailed strategy on what comes next. In a social media post Saturday evening, he said bombings could continue “as long as necessary.”___Associated Press writer Sean Murphy in Oklahoma City contributed to this report. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                STEVEN SLOAN\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Sloan is the Washington correspondent at The Associated Press.

        "text": "Police stands next to a plane that crashed in El Alto, Bolivia, Friday, Feb. 27, 2026. (AP Photo/Juan Karita)2026-02-28T00:49:07Z\n                                        LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — A cargo plane carrying money crashed Friday near Bolivia’s capital, damaging about a dozen vehicles on highway, scattering bills on the ground and leaving at least 15 people dead and others injured, an official said.Defense Minister Marcelo Salinas said the Hercules C-130 plane was transporting newly printed Bolivian currency when it “landed and veered off the runway” at an airport in El Alto, a city adjacent to the capital of La Paz, before ending up in a nearby field. Firefighters managed to put out the flames that engulfed the aircraft. Fire chief Pavel Tovar said at least 15 people died but he did not clarify if the dead were in the plane or in the cars on the nearby highway. Salinas did not specify how many people had been killed in the crash and said the cause was being investigated. Bolivian Air Force Gen. Sergio Lora said two of the plane’s six crew members had not been found as of late Friday, adding that the aircraft was arriving from the eastern city of Santa Cruz. \n    \n        \n    \n\nImages on social media showed debris from the aircraft, destroyed cars and bodies scattered on the road. According to Tovar, at least 15 vehicles were damaged. \n\nThe plane, belonging to the Bolivian air force, was transporting money to La Paz and images on social media showed people rushing to collect the bills scattered at the crash site, while police in riot gear tried to disperse them.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nTovar said the hundreds of people trying to collect the spilled bills were hindering rescue efforts.More than 500 soldiers and 100 police officers took control of the area to disperse the mob, according to official reports. Police and military personnel burned the cash boxes in the presence of Central Bank President David Espinoza, who said the bills “have no legal value because they never entered circulation,” without clarifying what that meant. Espinoza did not specify the amount of money being transported but he said the banknotes had arrived in Santa Cruz from abroad.

The concern followed Liam Conejo Ramos and his father when they were sent to Dilley, surrounded by chain-link fences on a dusty plain about 75 miles south of San Antonio.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nBut Liam was hardly an outlier. ICE has been holding hundreds of children at Dilley — many for months.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“We are all Liam,” Christian Hinojosa, an immigrant from Mexico, said by phone from Dilley, where she and her 13-year-old son were held for more than four months. They were released this month and allowed to return home to San Antonio where she works as a health aide.She noted that Liam and his father were released from Dilley after 10 days, when members of Congress and a judge intervened.“My son says, ‘That’s unfair, Mama. What’s the difference between him and us?’”\n    \n        \n    \n\nRamping up family detentions When the Obama administration opened Dilley in 2014, nearly all families detained there had recently crossed the border from Mexico. Detentions at the facility were scaled back by the Biden administration in 2021, before it was closed three years later.___EDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide.

The government is holding many children well beyond the 20-day limit set by longstanding court order. And many detainees have lived in the U.S. for several years, with roots in neighborhoods, workplaces and schools, according to lawyers and other observers.“Just imagine that you’re a child and you’re taken out of your surroundings,” said Philip Schrag, a Georgetown University law professor and author of “Baby Jails: The Fight to End the Incarceration of Refugee Children in America.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nSuddenly you’re in “a completely strange environment with the doors locked and guards in uniform roaming around,” said Schrag, who counseled Dilley detainees as a volunteer lawyer during the Obama administration.\n    \n    Have a news tip?Contact AP’s global investigative team at [email&#160;protected].

On an average day more than 220 children were held, with most of those detained longer than 24 hours sent to Dilley. More than half of Dilley detainees during that period were children.\n            \n                \n                    \n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n                    A young immigrant girl who just arrived at the Holding Institute, a shelter in Laredo, Texas on Feb. 12, 2026, pets a cat as her mother and other families receive a welcome and instructions on how to purchase tickets to get back to their homes in the U.S. (AP Photo/Valerie Gonzalez)\n                \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                \n                            A young immigrant girl who just arrived at the Holding Institute, a shelter in Laredo, Texas on Feb. 12, 2026, pets a cat as her mother and other families receive a welcome and instructions on how to purchase tickets to get back to their homes in the U.S. (AP Photo/Valerie Gonzalez)\n                                \n\n    \n        \n-->\n            \n                Add AP News on Google \n                \n            \n                \n        Add AP News as your preferred source to see more of our stories on Google.\n                    \n        \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n-->\n\n            Share\n                \n                \n                \n                \n\n                \n                    \n                \n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                    Share\n                    \n                \n\n                \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                     \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    Facebook\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    Copy\n    Link copied\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        Print\n    \n\n\n                \n            \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        Email\n    \n\n\n                \n            \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        \n    \n    X\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n    LinkedIn\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\nBluesky\n\n                \n            \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n        \n    \n    Flipboard\n\n                \n            \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n    \n        \n    Pinterest\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    Reddit\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n                \n\n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Read More\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n                \n            \n        Nearly two-thirds of children detained by ICE were eventually deported and almost 1 in 10 left the country when their parents accepted voluntary departure, according to an AP analysis of the latest comprehensive data. About a quarter were released in the U.S., requiring their parents to check in regularly with ICE as their legal cases proceed.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe number of detainees at Dilley has risen sharply since the period covered by the data, nearly tripling between last fall and late January to more than 1,300, according to Relevant Research, which analyzes immigration enforcement data.“We’ve started to use 100 days as a benchmark for prioritizing cases because so many children are exceeding 20 days,” said Leecia Welch, the chief legal director at Children’s Rights, who visits Dilley regularly to ensure compliance. In a visit this month, Welch said she counted more than 30 children who had been held for over 100 days.The increased detention of children comes as the Trump administration has gutted a Department of Homeland Security office responsible for oversight of conditions inside Dilley and other facilities.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“It’s a particular concern that family detention is being increased,” said Dr. Pamela McPherson, a child and adolescent psychiatrist contracted by DHS from 2014 until last year to inspect and investigate conditions at Dilley and other ICE facilities holding children. “Just who’s providing that check-and-balance now?”Rep. Tony Gonzales, who represents the congressional district where Dilley is located, said multiple visits have convinced him criticism of the center is unfair.He said he’d been impressed by Dilley’s facilities and the professionalism and dedication of staff. “They’re not doing policy. They’re just fulfilling a duty,” said Gonzales, a Republican.DHS did not respond to detailed questions about Dilley submitted by the AP. But both DHS and ICE sharply refuted allegations of poor care and conditions there.“The Dilley facility is a family residential center designed specifically to house family units in a safe, structured and appropriate environment,” ICE Director Todd M. Lyons said in a statement this week. Services include medical screenings, infant care packages as well as classrooms and recreational spaces.But concerns about Dilley are personal for Kheilin Valero Marcano, a Venezuelan immigrant detained with her husband and 1-year-old daughter, Amalia, in December and held for nearly two months.\n            \n                \n                    \n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n                    Migrants from Venezuela, Stiven Arrieta Prieto and his wife, Kheilin Valero Marcano, with their 18-month-old daughter, Amalia Arrieta Valero, pose for a photo in Southern California on Tuesday, Feb. 10, 2026.

Two weeks later, Amalia started vomiting, then losing weight. Valero Marcano said she took her to the Dilley doctor’s office at least eight times but was offered Tylenol and ibuprofen.The baby was eventually sent to two hospitals, where doctors diagnosed COVID, bronchitis, pneumonia and stomach virus, she said.ICE disputed Valero Marcano’s account, saying in a statement the baby “immediately received proper medical care” at Dilley before being sent to the hospital. Back in Dilley, “she was in the medical unit and received proper treatment and prescribed medicines,” it said.The family’s return to Dilley coincided with a measles outbreak there. They were released earlier this month after their lawyers petitioned the court.“I’m so worried for all the families who are still inside,” Valero Marcano said. A teen in distressAfter more than two months in a cramped room at Dilley with three other families, the 13-year-old girl’s depression turned increasingly dark.The eighth grader stopped eating after finding a worm in her food, family members said. Staff sometimes withheld medications she’d long been prescribed to keep her anxiety in check and help her sleep.When a total lockdown was imposed, a guard blocked the teen from leaving the crowded room to join her mother and sister in the bathroom. She spiraled into crisis, and used a plastic knife from the cafeteria to cut her wrist.“She said she didn’t want to live anymore because she preferred to die rather than having to keep living in confinement,” her mother, Andrea Armero, told the AP in a video call from Colombia, where the family was deported this month. The AP generally avoids identifying people who attempt or die by suicide.The girl’s struggles began before she arrived at Dilley. Soon after starting middle school in Colombia, she learned a family member had sexually abused her younger sister. Armero said she saw no option but to leave and in early 2024 she and her daughters traveled to the U.S. border with Mexico, applying for asylum.Living with family in Florida, the 13-year-old was doing well in school but sometimes experienced panic attacks about being sent back to Colombia. Under a psychiatrist’s care, she was prescribed anti-anxiety and anti-depression medications and regularly saw a therapist. Then, in December, ICE agents detained Armero and her daughters during a routine check-in.At Dilley, the 13-year-old calmed herself by drawing, producing haunting pictures of a girl locked inside gates. But when she and other detainees took part in a protest after 5-year-old Liam and his father got to Dilley, guards took away drawing materials and ordered everyone to stay inside. \n            \n                \n                    \n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n                    This image provided by the family in February 2026 shows a drawing made by a 13-year-old Colombian girl when she was detained at South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, where the Trump administration is holding immigrant families.

She tried to harm herself with the plastic knife, Armero said, and repeatedly hit her head. The family was put into isolation without seeing a doctor, then deported to Colombia on Feb. 11 after a judge ordered them removed, she said.Dilley discharge documents described “active problems,” including a “suicide attempt by cutting of wrist” and “self-harm,” in addition to a “history of post-traumatic stress disorder” and “history of anxiety.” AP also spoke with detainees and attorneys who independently described the girl’s suicide attempt.Responding to questions from AP, a DHS official acknowledged there had been “a case of self-harm” inside the facility, but did not specify what had happened, or how staff handled the incident. When AP asked for details, DHS did not respond to follow-up questions.“No child at Dilley ... has been denied medical treatment or experienced a delayed medical assessment,” said Ryan Gustin, a spokesman for CoreCivic, the for-profit prison company that operates the facility under contract with ICE. Gustin declined to answer specific question about the 13-year-old girl, citing privacy rules.Detention weighs on childrenOn a phone call from inside Dilley, 13-year-old Gustavo Santino-Josa introduced himself to a reporter by name and the 9-digit identification number ICE assigned him when he was taken into custody with his mother.“Until today I don’t know what we did wrong to get detained,” Gustavo said. “I’ve seen my mom cry almost daily and I ask God that we can go out and go home soon.”He worried they might never be released.“My mom says that as long as there is hope it is worth fighting for,” Gustavo said before handing the phone to his mother, Christian Hinojosa, the health care aide originally from Mexico. “All his friends have left already,” his mother said. “Some were deported. Some got released recently. And it hurts. It hurts to see people leaving and you’re staying here.”\n            \n                \n                    \n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n                    Andrea Armero, right, and her daughter, who were deported from the United States, sit in a park in Colombia, on Wednesday, Feb. 18, 2026.

The water tastes terrible and causes stomachaches and rashes, so some families stick to what they can buy in the commissary.Their children don’t eat enough and have lost weight, Welch said. There are classrooms, but instruction is limited to an hour daily, mostly filling out worksheets.A 14-year-old girl, identified in court papers by the initials NVSM, reported there were tensions with up to 12 people sharing their room. At night when she and her mother tried to sleep, others insisted on turning up the TV.“I feel very sad and stressed to be here,” the teen said in an account filed with the court that oversees a binding settlement governing detention and release of children. “My nerves are so high. I don’t know what is happening. My muscles will twitch because I’m so nervous and on edge.”Concerns about oversightAs the government’s detention of parents and their children came under scrutiny in 2014, an ICE official insisted that family detention centers, equipped with basketball courts and medical clinics, were “more like a summer camp.”The characterization irritated McPherson, the child psychiatrist who, along with another physician, was retained in 2014 by DHS to inspect family detention centers. Their contracts were not renewed by the Trump administration last year after DHS announced sweeping staff reductions.“Having a clean place to sleep, having food, that’s not the same thing as having family and community,” McPherson said.The doctors’ investigations of family detention centers exposed consistently inadequate staffing and disregard by administrators for the trauma caused by detention, concerns they reported in 2018 to a Senate caucus set up to hear from whistleblowers.At Dilley, the doctors noted a persistent shortage of pediatricians and the inability to hire a child psychiatrist from the time they began their inspections until they alerted senators. Employees unsure how to deal with 2-year-olds biting and hitting each other placed the children and their parents in medical isolation for days, McPherson and her colleague told senators. Without supervision, a nurse at Dilley gave adult-strength hepatitis A shots to about 250 children in 2015, the American Immigration Lawyers Association reported.\n            \n                \n                    \n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n                    Kheilin Valero Marcano, hugs her 18-month-old daughter, Amalia Arrieta Valero, in Southern California on Tuesday, Feb. 10, 2026.

The first Trump administration increased family detention before the Biden administration began phasing it out in 2021. That the Trump administration is again holding families at Dilley after so many warnings feels “dystopian,” McPherson said.“The decision to knowingly traumatize children and subject them to chronic stress, I just have no words for it,” she said.Worries even after releaseHuddled around picnic tables at the Laredo migrant shelter, parents released from Dilley searched anxiously for flights back to the homes they left behind. They called relatives, friends, teachers, anyone who might help with money to get there.The young Ecuadorian mom talked of returning to Minneapolis, where her 2-year-old daughter, born in the U.S., was staying with a friend. With her husband deported, parenting will be entirely her responsibility.That means getting her 7-year-old back in school. Then the woman, who had a work permit and a job in a Minneapolis restaurant before being detained, needs to keep her children fed.“Let’s go home, Mom, but don’t go back to work because ICE is going to pick you up again,” the little girl said. Her mother tried to reassure her.That won’t happen, she said, because now they have a special paper telling ICE to leave them alone. She hopes that’s a promise she can keep.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n     \n\n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n—AP Data Reporter Aaron Kessler contributed from Washington.___Contact AP’s global investigative team at [email&#160;protected] or https://www.ap.org/tips/\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                GARANCE BURKE\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Burke is a global investigative journalist with The Associated Press based in San Francisco.

        "title": "Democrats look to Tejano music star Bobby Pulido in a high-stakes South Texas congressional race",
        "text": "Democratic candidate for congress Bobby Pulido makes a campaign stop in Pharr, Texas, Tuesday, Feb. 10, 2026. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)2026-02-28T14:03:40Z\n                                        PHARR, Texas (AP) — Latin Grammy winner Bobby Pulido’s music fills the air well before he walks into an adult day care center to round up support for his congressional campaign, his voice crooning in Spanish from a speaker in the corner. A few of the people playing cards and bantering playfully at the South Texas center ask about the man in cowboy boots, dark jeans, leather jacket and an ivory cowboy hat as the Democrat makes his entrance, but most barely notice. Then the music fades, and Pulido takes a microphone. It is important to vote and ensure your children do, too, he says in Spanish, “because the truth is that we are living in difficult times right now and it is important to make a change.”Pulido has had a three-decade career in Tejano music, a style that evolved in the fields and barrios of South Texas. A world away in Washington, Democrats are betting that his celebrity can reverse the party’s deteriorating standing among Hispanics, whose political support has shifted to Republicans in the Trump era. They also see him as the party’s best hope to win a district that was engineered to protect U.S. Rep. Monica De La Cruz, the only House Republican from Texas’ Rio Grande Valley. \n    \n        \n    \n\nWith three competitive races this fall, the region is at the center of the battle to control the House after Texas Republicans, at President Donald Trump’s request, redrew congressional district boundaries to give their party an edge. The party primaries are Tuesday.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nPulido is a newcomer to politics who still has two stops left on a farewell music tour, including one this weekend in Mexico. In the Democratic primary, he faces Ada Cuellar, a doctor and law school graduate who is running to his left, with the race reflecting broader party dynamics. Cuellar argues that Pulido is out of touch with voters and that he and the party establishment are putting too much stock in his music-star status. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nBoth Democrats in the closely contested U.S. Senate primary have waded into the congressional race, with state Rep. James Talarico campaigning with Pulido and U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett with Cuellar. The Democratic nominee in the 15th Congressional District will face an even tougher general election landscape. De La Cruz won the seat by 14 percentage points in 2024, even before Republicans tweaked the boundaries to solidify her position.\n    \n        \n    \n\nPulido runs from the center in a changing districtThe area Pulido hopes to represent stretches from the Mexican border 300 miles north through ranches and small towns. It is 81% Hispanic, poorer than the state and nation as a whole, and overwhelmingly Catholic. It encapsulates the shift of working-class voters Hispanics to the Republican Party, one of the defining political trends of the Trump era.In the newly constituted district, Democrats saw their support in recent presidential elections fall from 55% for Hillary Clinton in 2016 to 41% for Kamala Harris in 2024.Pulido has staked out moderate positions that nod to the region’s cultural conservatism, sometimes drawing the ire of the left. He says, for example, that he opposes abortion but supports letting women decide for themselves.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“Even if I personally would not be OK with it, I still respect that other people might make their own decisions and that we have to be OK with that,” he said.Pulido has faced scrutiny for years of bawdy social media posts, including crude and sexist jokes and links to pornographic websites. He once posted a video purporting to show him urinating on Trump’s star on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame. The singer later said it was a prank with a water bottle.“My sense of humor on social media — and it’s very much in Spanish, I have a lot of fans in Mexico — sometimes that humor doesn’t translate,” Pulido said. He said he was embarrassed by some of his old posts.\n    \n        \n    \n\nTough opposition in primary and general electionsCuellar, Pulido’s chief opponent in the Democratic primary, is emphasizing her experience in the trenches of the health care system. She contrasts her expertise in public policy with Pulido’s as a performer.“He doesn’t really understand the issues or have the solutions that I have,” she said.Cuellar is running a more progressive campaign, saying Pulido is out of touch with Democratic voters on abortion in particular.Pulido is not so much a threat because he is famous, she said, but because he aggressively has backed by “the establishment” in Washington and locally in Hidalgo County, the district’s largest population center. Cuellar said officials, whom she did not name, have pushed her to drop out of the race.“I am like a scrappy underdog, and I’ve been one my whole life,” Cuellar said. “So I really am not concerned about the celebrity itself, but I’m fighting this establishment pressure, and that’s really the biggest challenge I’m faced with.”She has largely self-funded her campaign to keep pace with Pulido’s spending and has aired television ads, while he has not.\n    \n        \n    \n\nNational Democratic leaders believe Pulido’s more moderate positions make him the best general election candidate against De La Cruz. Though largely aligned with Trump and the House leadership, she was one of only 17 House Republicans to vote with Democrats on a bill extending Affordable Care Act subsidies.Speaking before Trump at a rally in Corpus Christi on Friday, De La Cruz said she has worked with him to pressure Mexico to release water it owes from the countries’ shared Rio Grande basin. “We have together delivered for Texas and delivered for our nation by turning all of South Texas red, and we will continue to keep Texas red,” De La Cruz said. Celebrity ‘opens the door’Inside My Morning Star Adult Day Care, where Pulido spoke on a recent day, his music returned as he made rounds from table to table, shaking hands and making small talk in English or Spanish, depending on how he was greeted.“I’ll ask the sky to not make me suffer anymore,” Pulido’s voice is heard over an accordion and rhythmic percussion, narrating a story of heartbreak and longing. The 1997 song, “Le Pediré,” is among the hits of his three-decade career.Pulido won Latin Grammy Awards for Best Tejano Album in 2022 and 2025 and was nominated this year for an American Grammy. He is steeped in the culture of Tejano music, which blends Mexican folk styles with European dance music brought here by Czech, German and Polish settlers. It is deeply rooted in this narrow region of Central and South Texas, where many can trace their lineage to the Republic of Texas before it joined the United States.Pulido’s father, Roberto Pulido, was a pioneer of the genre, which has receded in popularity since its heyday in the 1990s, when Selena broke through as a mainstream pop artist.More than just celebrity, Bobby Pulido’s deep history in the genre gives him credibility with people in the area, said Cathy Ragland, an ethnomusicology professor at University of North Texas, who studies U.S.-Mexico border music.“He is a homegrown guy in the border, and that gets you a lot of mileage,” she said. Celebrity is an asset when running for office, Pulido said later, sitting on a bench outside the adult day care center. But it is no guarantee of success.“I’m not going to lie, it opens the door. It doesn’t seal the deal,” Pulido said. “I don’t think people vote for you because you’re famous. They’ll listen to you because you’re famous, and then they’re going to decide if they want to vote for you or not.”\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JONATHAN J.

        "title": "Racial slur at BAFTA awards stirs complex feelings for Black people with Tourette syndrome",
        "text": "New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams delivers remarks during a protest in response to the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by a federal immigration officer this morning in Minneapolis, Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026, in New York. (AP Photo/Ryan Murphy, File)2026-02-28T13:59:56Z\n                                        For Black people living with Tourette syndrome, the British Academy Film and Television Arts Awards incident earlier this week where a vocal tic manifested as a racial slur while two Black stars of the movie “Sinners” were onstage has left them with complicated feelings. “It’s been pretty difficult because I feel like there’s such a clash between both sides,” said Chloe Winston, 24, who experiences coprolalia, the same verbal tic as John Davidson, the BAFTA nominee and Tourette syndrome advocate who yelled the slur. “A tic is not intentional, but it still causes harm. And I think that does require accountability.”Davidson’s utterance just as Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo were presenting the first award of that night’s ceremony ignited a firestorm that overshadowed Sunday’s BAFTAs. There was immediate outrage that the actors and other Black attendees were subjected to the slur. Then there was frustration from the disability community at a lack of understanding about Tourette syndrome. But anger has been loud and widespread for broadcaster BBC because of its decision to allow the racial slur to air uncensored two hours after the live event. Most live awards shows like the Oscars operate on a seconds-long tape delay. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe BAFTA and BBC apologies also were criticized as insufficient. The BBC plans to edit it out of its iPlayer streaming service.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe ordeal has compelled Black people with Tourette syndrome, from politicians to content creators, to speak out. They assert that showing empathy for those dealing with the disorder doesn’t minimize the pain felt by the Black community. There needs to be acknowledgment of the harm, some have said. Others also worry that misinformation or stereotypes about Tourette syndrome could exacerbate racial profiling or discrimination for Black people who live with it.Now, advocacy groups are using the BAFTA moment to try to grow existing support networks focused on Black people who feel isolated by Tourette syndrome. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nWhat is Tourette syndrome and coprolalia?Tourette syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by sudden, involuntary movements and/or sounds called tics, according to the Tourette Association of America. These can be motor and vocal tics. Tics can range from mild and inconsequential to moderate and severe and can even be disabling in some cases. “We know that there’s this sort of sensory and motor loop happening. And again, similarly in the vocalizations, they typically start with things like coughing, sniffing, or other just non-specific sounds, said Dr. Jeremiah Scharf, a tic disorder specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital.In a majority of people, the symptoms begin to emerge during elementary school age and peak between ages 10 and 14, according to Scharf. Roughly 1.4 million people in the U.S. live with Tourette syndrome or a persistent tic disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n    \n        \n    \n\nCoprolalia is “the involuntary utterance of obscene and socially unacceptable words and phrases.” The Tourette Association of America estimates between 10%-15% of people with Tourette syndrome live with it. The organization has cautioned against making assumptions about the person based on the content of the tic.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThese vocal outbursts — typically vulgarities and insults — are a biological condition that can sometimes be triggered by stress such as not enough sleep or being upset, Scharf said. The tics are hard to stop and involuntary — almost like a sneeze.“Unfortunately, for this subset of people, it is incredibly disabling because they don’t want to say those things. It’s very distressing to them,” said Scharf, who was talking in general terms and not about the BAFTA awards incident specifically. “They feel significant remorse about it.”Treatment for severe tic disorders can range from medication to behavioral therapies. Retraining the brain to handle tics is “takes an enormous amount of practice in terms of recognizing when the tics are coming,” Scharf said. But, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. \n    \n        \n    \n\nIncident stirs up struggles against racism and ableism Jhónelle Bean, an American Sign Language interpreter who is Black and has Tourette syndrome, took to TikTok after seeing so much “all-or-nothing” discourse around the BAFTA awards. Her video about the “complexity and duality of the situation” has garnered over 3 million views.“Two things can be true at the same time,” Bean said. “Just because he ticced that does not mean it was intentional. But then also that still caused hurt or harm for people that heard it, which again is why I’m mad at the BAFTAs and the BBC for keeping it in the broadcast in the first place because they had the power to take it out.”The incident also brought up “ableism” comments that were flat-out discriminatory. They included that Davidson, the man who shouted the racial slur, “should have been locked away, he should’ve had a muzzle, things like that,” Bean said. \n    \n        \n    \n\nAt the same time, Bean disagreed with some engaged in the social media discourse who said those who took offense over the N-word needed to “get over it.”Jumaane Williams, New York City’s public advocate who is Black and has Tourette syndrome, said it can be “painful both physically and mentally” to hold in a tic. As someone who has coprolalia too, Williams gives Davidson some credit for removing himself from the situation though “maybe he could have moved a little sooner.”“For me, it was all about making sure we’re practicing care. And I don’t think that happened for the two actors that were there or the Black folks who were there or people who didn’t want to hear the word,” Williams said.A demand for support groups for Black people with Tourette syndrome There’s always going to be inherent concern if you are Black with Tourette syndrome or any tic disorder, said Reice Griffin, 20, who is a Tourette Association of America rising leader and ambassador. She has had people witness her tics and assume she uses drugs or is typically belligerent. And interacting with police can be even more stressful.“Law enforcement is not well equipped to deal with Tourette syndrome, but also historically, as a Black person, you never really want to be around law enforcement,” Griffin said.The association, which offers printable “I Have TS” cards, is actively trying to offer more support for people of color. Griffin recently attended a virtual support group meeting for Black young adults, and she has been speaking at schools and to groups to become more comfortable with herself.“I thought that because I had Tourette syndrome that, like, public speaking was out the window,” Griffin said. “If I could help another young Black girl with Tourette syndrome not feel as alone or help people get diagnosed — that’s the dream.”Williams, the New York City public advocate, agrees there is not enough support for Black people with Tourette syndrome. He tries to help by speaking about his own life. That has led to him hearing directly from New Yorkers.“Sometimes in the street or an event people will bring their family member up which is always a pretty emotional space for me because when I see the kid, I know what they’re going through,” Williams said.—-Tang reported from Phoenix.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                TERRY TANG\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Tang reports on race and ethnicity issues, including Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, for The Associated Press.

        "title": "A Supreme Court case over whether marijuana users can own guns is creating unusual alliances",
        "text": "The Supreme Court is seen, Jan. 13, 2026, in Washington. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson, File)2026-02-28T13:24:42Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — Gun rights and cannabis legalization are usually on opposite ends of the political spectrum, but both movements have brought about seismic shifts in the United States in recent decades.Now those forces are lining up for a rare overlap in a case coming before the Supreme Court on Monday, and it is not the only unusual alliance. The Republican Trump administration will be defending a firearm restriction, with backing from gun-control groups typically more aligned with Democrats. On the other side is a pairing of the National Rifle Association and the American Civil Liberties Union. At stake is a federal law that bars people who regularly use marijuana from legally owning guns. It is an issue that has divided lower courts since a landmark 2022 Supreme Court decision expanded gun rights.Cecillia Wang, legal director at the ACLU, said the law violates the Second Amendment and is unconstitutionally vague about what it means to be a drug user. \n    \n        \n    \n\n“We’re deeply concerned with the potential of this statute to basically give federal prosecutors a blank check,” she said. “Millions of Americans use marijuana and there is no way for them to know based on words of this statute whether they could be charged or convicted of this crime because they own a firearm.” \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nCannabis is legal for medicinal use in most states and for recreational use in about half the country. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nBut the law also applies more widely against all illegal substances, meaning the case could allow broader legal gun use by other drug users. The group Everytown for Gun Safety said the law meets the Supreme Court’s requirement that gun laws must have a strong grounding in the nation’s history and tradition.“Restricting firearm use by illegal drug users is ‘as old as legislative recognition of the drug problem itself,’” attorneys wrote. Cannabis remains illegal on a federal level, though President Donald Trump has signed an order to fast-track its reclassification as a less dangerous drug.\n    \n        \n    \n\nHis Justice Department is also asking the justices to revive a criminal case against Ali Danial Hemani, a Texas man who was charged with a felony because he had a gun in his house and acknowledged smoking marijuana every other day. FBI agents also found a small amount of cocaine when they searched his home as part of a broader investigation, but the gun charge was the only one filed against him. The conservative-leaning 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the case, finding that only people who are intoxicated while armed can be charged with a crime.The administration has argued in favor of gun rights in other cases, but government lawyers say this law is a justifiable restriction. “Habitual illegal drug users with firearms present unique dangers to society — especially because they pose a grave risk of armed, hostile encounters with police officers while impaired,” they wrote in court documents. The law fits within the nation’s history of restrictions on people who were frequently drunk, they argued. While the conservative-majority Supreme Court has expanded gun rights, it also has upheld a federal law disarming people who are subject to domestic violence restraining orders. The Department of Justice argues that drug users are similarly risky. The law it is asking the court to uphold was also used in the case of Hunter Biden, who was convicted of buying a gun when he was addicted to cocaine. \n    \n        \n    \n\nBut the NRA and other gun-rights groups, typically aligned with the GOP, are arrayed against the administration in Hemani’s case. “Americans have traditionally chosen which substances are acceptable for responsible recreational use, and the fundamental right to keep and bear arms was never denied to people who occasionally partook in such drugs — unless they were carrying arms while actively intoxicated,” lawyers for the Second Amendment Foundation wrote in court documents.The cannabis group NORML agrees, saying one of the fastest-growing groups of users are baby boomers trying products such as marijuana gummies to relieve arthritis and sleep problems. “It’s laughable to think that by outlawing cannabis users possessing firearms you’ll minimize the problem with gun violence,” said Joe A. Bondy, chair of the board of directors for NORML, one of the country’s oldest and largest groups advocating for the legalization of marijuana. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                LINDSAY WHITEHURST\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Whitehurst covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs for The Associated Press.

        "text": "SummaryAmazon MGM Studios and Sony Pictures Television have revealed the first official image for the upcoming God of War live-action seriesRyan Hurst stars as Kratos alongside Callum Vinson as his son, Atreus, as production officially begins in VancouverThe adaptation will follow the narrative of the 2018 soft reboot, focusing on the father-son journey to spread Faye's ashesPrime Video has officially pulled back the curtain on its highly anticipated God of War adaptation, sharing a first-look image of the series' lead duo. Stepping into the mythic world of Midgard, Ryan Hurst takes on the legendary role of the Spartan warrior Kratos, with Callum Vinson co-starring as his young son, Atreus.With production now underway in Vancouver, Canada, the live-action series aims to faithfully translate the critically acclaimed 2018 PlayStation game to the small screen. The debut promotional image mirrors the opening moments of the video game, showcasing Kratos in a teaching stance alongside Atreus, bow in hand. Hurst is no stranger to the franchise's Norse saga, having previously delivered a BAFTA-nominated performance as Thor in the 2022 sequel God of War Ragnarök.Showrunner Ronald D. Moore takes the creative helm for the two-season order, co-produced by Amazon MGM Studios, Sony Pictures Television, and PlayStation Productions. The narrative will trace Kratos and Atreus as they embark on a perilous journey to honor the final wish of Kratos' wife and Atreus' mother, Faye. Along the rugged path, Kratos strives to teach his son how to be a better god, while Atreus attempts to show his father how to be a more compassionate human.Rounding out the godly ensemble are heavy hitters including Mandy Patinkin as the All-Father Odin, Ólafur Darri Ólafsson as Thor, and Ed Skrein as Baldur. Award-winning director Frederick E.O. Toye is locked in to direct the first two episodes.Check out the first look image above and stay tuned for an official trailer.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "title": "Xiangyi Cheng Is Bringing AR to Classrooms and Hospitals",
        "text": "When Xiangyi Cheng published her first journal paper as a principal investigator in IEEE Access in 2024, it marked more than a professional milestone. For Cheng, an IEEE member and an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Loyola Marymount University, in Los Angeles, it was the latest waypoint in a career shaped by curiosity, persistence, and a belief that technology should serve people—not the other way around.The paper’s title was “Mobile Devices or Head-Mounted Displays: A Comparative Review and Analysis of Augmented Reality in Healthcare.”XIANGYI CHENGEmployer Loyola Marymount University, in Los AngelesTitle Assistant professor of mechanical engineeringMember grade MemberAlma maters China University of Mining and Technology; Texas A&amp;M UniversityCheng’s work spans robotics, intelligent systems, human-machine interaction and  artificial intelligence. It has applications in patient-specific surgical planning, an approach whereby treatment is customized to the anatomy and clinical needs of each individual.Her research also covers wearables for rehabilitation and augmented-reality-enhanced engineering education.The throughline of her career is sound judgment based on critical thinking. She urges her students to avoid the temptation to accept the answers they’re given by AI without cross-checking them against their own foundational understanding of the subject matter.“AI can give you ideas,” Cheng says, “but it should never lead your thinking.”That principle—honed through uncertainty, disciplinary shifts, and hard-earned confidence—has made Cheng an emerging voice in applied intelligent systems and a thoughtful educator preparing students for an AI-saturated world.From Xi’an to Beijing: A mind drawn to mathematicsCheng, born in Xi’an, China, grew up in a household shaped by her parents’ disparate careers. Her father was a mining engineer, and her mother taught Chinese and literature at a high school.“That contrast between logical and literary thinking helped me understand myself early,” Cheng says. “I liked math, and STEM felt natural to me.”Several teachers reinforced her inclination, she says, particularly a math teacher whose calm, fair approach emphasized reasoning over punishments such as detention for misbehavior or failure to complete assignments.“It wasn’t about being right,” Cheng says. “It was about thinking clearly.”She moved to Beijing in 2011 to attend the China University of Mining and Technology , where she studied mechanical engineering. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in 2015, she was unsure where the field would take her.An IEEE paper changed her trajectoryLater in 2015, she traveled to the United States to study at Case Western Reserve University, in Cleveland.She initially viewed the move as exploratory rather than a long-term commitment.“I wasn’t thinking about a Ph.D.,” she says. “I wasn’t even sure research was for me.”That uncertainty shifted in 2017, when Cheng submitted her “IntuBot: Design and Prototyping of a Robotic Intubation Device” paper to the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)—which was accepted.“AI can give you more possibilities, but thinking is still our responsibility.”Intubation is a procedure in which an endotracheal tube is inserted into a patient’s airway—usually through the mouth—to help them breathe. Because placing the tube correctly is not simple and usually must be done quickly, it requires training. That’s why research into robotic or assisted intubation systems focuses on improving speed, accuracy, and safety.She presented her findings at ICRA in 2018, giving her early exposure to a global research community.“That acceptance gave me confidence,” she recalls. “It showed me I could contribute to the field.”Her advisor at Case Western encouraged her to switch from the mechanical engineering master’s program to the Ph.D. track. When the advisor moved to Texas A&amp;M University, in College Station, in 2019, Cheng decided to transfer. She completed her Ph.D. in mechanical engineering at Texas A&amp;M in 2022.Although she didn’t earn a degree from Case Western, she credits her experience there with clarifying her professional direction.Shortly after graduating with her Ph.D., Cheng was hired as an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Ohio Northern University, in Ada. She left in 2024 to become an assistant professor at Loyola Marymount.Engineering for the body—and the classroomCheng’s research focuses on human-centered engineering, particularly in health care. One of her major projects addresses syndactyly, a congenital condition in which a newborn’s fingers are fused at birth. Surgeons rely on their experience to estimate the size and shape of skin grafts to be taken from another part of the body for the corrective surgery.She is developing technology to scan the patient’s hand, extract anatomical landmarks, and use finite element analysis—a computer-based method for predicting how a physical object will behave under real-world conditions—to determine the optimal graft size and shape.  Xiangyi Cheng designs human-centered intelligent systems with applications in health care and education.Xiangyi Cheng“Everyone’s hand is different,” Cheng says. “So the surgery should be personalized.”Another project centers on developing smart gloves to assist with hand rehabilitation, pairing the unaffected hand with the injured one so the person’s natural motion can help guide therapy.She also is exploring augmented reality in engineering education, using immersive visualization and AI tools to help students grasp three-dimensional concepts that are difficult to convey through traditional learning tools. Such visualization lets students see and interact with a digital world as if they’re inside it instead of viewing it on a flat screen.Teaching balance in an AI-driven worldDespite working at the forefront of AI-enabled systems, Cheng cautions her students to be judicious in their use of the technology so that they don’t rely on it too heavily.“AI is not always right and perfect,” she says. “You still need to be able to judge whether the answers it provides are correct.”As AI continues to reshape engineering, Cheng remains grounded in a simple principle, she says: “We should use these tools. But we should never let them replace our judgment. AI can give you more possibilities, but thinking is still our responsibility.”In her lab and classroom, Cheng prioritizes independent thinking, critical evaluation, and persistence. Many of her research students are undergraduates, and she encourages them to take ownership of their work—planning ahead, testing ideas, and learning from failure.“The students who succeed don’t give up easily,” she says.What she finds most rewarding, she says, is watching students mature. Reserved first-year students often become confident seniors who can present complex work and manage demanding projects.“Getting to witness that transformation is why I teach,” she says.For students considering engineering, Cheng offers straightforward advice: “Focus on mathematics. Engineering looks hands-on, but math is the foundation behind everything.”With practice and persistence, she says, students can succeed and find meaning in the field.Why IEEE continues to matterCheng joined IEEE in 2017, the year she submitted her first paper to ICRA. The organization has remained central to her professional development, she says.She has served as a reviewer for IEEE journals and conferences including Robotics and Automation Letters, Transactions on Medical Robotics and Bionics, Transactions on Robotics, the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, and ICRA.IEEE’s interdisciplinary scope aligns naturally with her work, she says, adding that the organization is “one of the few places that truly welcomes research across boundaries.”More personally, IEEE helped her see a future she had not initially imagined.“That first conference was a turning point,” she says. “It helped me realize I belonged.”",

        "title": "This Power Grid Pioneer’s EV Prediction Came 100 Years Too Soon",
        "text": "Charles Proteus Steinmetz was a towering figure in the early decades of electrical engineering, easily the intellectual equal of Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla—men he considered his friends. One of Steinmetz’s most significant achievements was to quantify and characterize the phenomenon of magnetic hysteresis—the behavior of magnetism in materials—and then devise a simple law that allowed for predictable transformer and motor design. He also established a revolutionary framework for analyzing AC circuits, which is still taught today in power engineering. And from 1893, he served as chief consulting engineer at General Electric at a pivotal moment for the young company and for the U.S. effort to expand its power grid. For these and other accomplishments, he was well known in his time, even if he’s not exactly a household name today.Steinmetz was also an evangelist for electric vehicles. In March 1920, he typed out his thoughts, comparing the pros and cons of EVs to the gasoline-propelled alternative. Among the advantages: low cost of maintenance, reliability, simplicity of operation, and lower cost of operation. The disadvantages: dependence on charging stations, limited range on a single charge, and lower speeds. More than a century later, his list remains remarkably pertinent.Steinmetz could often be seen decked out in a suit and top hat, smoking his trademark BlackStone panatela cigar while riding around Schenectady, N.Y., in his 1914 Detroit Electric sedan. According to John Spinelli, emeritus professor of electrical and computer engineering at Union College, in Schenectady, sometimes both Steinmetz and his chauffeur sat in the backseat—you could control the car from both the front and the rear—so that it would appear to be a driverless car. With a top speed of 40 kilometers per hour (25 miles per hour), the car ran on 14 six-volt batteries and could go about 48 km between charges.  Steinmetz’s 1914 Detroit Electric car is now at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., where Steinmetz had founded, chaired, and taught in the department of electrical engineering.Paul Buckowski/Union CollegeIn 1971, the car was purchased by Union College, where Steinmetz had founded, chaired, and taught in the department of electrical engineering. The car had been discovered rotting in a field, so it needed some work. Over the next decade, faculty and engineering students restored it to its former glory. Still in running condition, it’s now on permanent display at the college.Steinmetz’s Contributions to Electrical EngineeringKarl August Rudolf Steinmetz was born in 1865 in Breslau, Prussia (now known as Wrocław, Poland). He studied mathematics, physics, and the burgeoning field of electricity at the University of Breslau. He also joined a student socialist club and edited the party newspaper, The People’s Voice. He completed his doctoral studies, but before receiving his degree, Steinmetz fled to Switzerland in 1888, after his socialist writings came under the scrutiny of the Bismarck government.Steinmetz immigrated to New York the following year, anglicized his first name, dropped his two middle names, and added Proteus, a nickname he had picked up at university (after the shape-shifting sea god of Greek mythology). Eventually, he became a U.S. citizen.  Charles Proteus Steinmetz solved a number of important problems that helped the power grid expand.Bettmann/Getty ImagesIn January 1892, Steinmetz burst onto the engineering scene when he read his paper “On the Law of Hysteresis” before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, a forerunner of today’s IEEE. I can’t quite imagine sitting through the delivery of its 62 pages, but those assembled recognized its groundbreaking nature. The ideas Steinmetz outlined allowed engineers to calculate power losses in the magnetic components of electrical machinery during the design phase. Prior to this, the design process for transformers and electric motors was largely trial and error, and power losses could be measured only after the machine was built, which greatly added to the cost.Steinmetz was not just an equations and theory guy, though. He loved working in the lab and building things. In 1893, General Electric acquired the small manufacturing firm of Eickemeyer & Osterheld, in Yonkers, N.Y., where Steinmetz had worked since shortly after his arrival in the United States. So Steinmetz began his new life as a corporate engineer, an interesting turn for the socialist. During his first few years with GE, he mostly designed generators and transformers. But he also created an informal position for himself as a consultant, giving expert opinions on various problems across divisions. He eventually formalized this role, becoming GE’s chief consulting engineer, and he maintained a relationship with the company for the rest of his life, even after joining the faculty of Union College in 1902.By the time Steinmetz died in 1923 at the age of 58, he had been granted more than 200 patents and had made major contributions to various subfields in electrical engineering, including phasors and complex numbers (for steady-state AC analysis); electrical transients, switching surges, and surge protection (based on his research on lightning); industrial research (including how to run a corporate lab); and engineering methods (by writing textbooks that standardized practice).Why Steinmetz Believed in Electric CarsBy 1914, Steinmetz was convinced that the future of transportation was electric. In June, he addressed the National Electric Light Association convention in Philadelphia with a bold prediction: “I have no doubt that in 10 years, more or less—rather less than more—we will see the field of the pleasure and business vehicle covered by such an electric car in large numbers. And I believe I underestimate when I say that 1,000,000 or more will be used.”As we now know, Steinmetz was overly optimistic. At the time, there were about 1.2 million gasoline-powered cars in use in the United States, and only about 35,000 EVs. It would take until 2018 for the number of EVs (including plug-in hybrids) on U.S. roads to surpass a million. Worldwide, there are now about 60 million electric vehicles in use.But Steinmetz had his reasons. He firmly believed that electric vehicles would flourish in urban areas, where most rides involved short distances at low speed. He also thought EVs would be a boon for power companies, which were eager to drum up more business, especially at night. With 1 million electric cars being charged about 5 kilowatt-hours on most nights, and at a rate of 5 cents per kilowatt-hour, Steinmetz predicted US $75 million (about $2.5 billion today) of new business for central power stations each year.  In 1971, Union College purchased Steinmetz’s car, which had been found rotting in a field, and faculty and students restored it to working condition.Special Collections & Archives/Schaffer Library/Union CollegeSteinmetz went to work to improve the electric car. He developed a double-rotor motor that was integrated into the rear axle, which did away with the need for a mechanical differential or drive shaft and drastically reduced the overall weight, which improved the mileage. Dey Electric Corp. incorporated Steinmetz’s design into its electric roadster and priced it under $1,000. Unfortunately, an internal combustion engine Ford Model T cost about half as much, and the Dey roadster flopped, ending production within a year.Undeterred, Steinmetz formed the Steinmetz Electric Motor Car Corp. in 1920 with the initial goal of bringing to market an electric truck for deliveries and light industrial use. The first truck debuted on a cold February day in 1922 with a publicity stunt of climbing the steep Miller Avenue hill in Brooklyn, N.Y. According to a report in The New York Times, the vehicle went up the 14.5 percent grade between Jamaica Avenue and Highland Boulevard in 51 seconds. During a second climb, it stopped a number of times to show how easily it restarted. The truck had a range of 84 km (52 miles).The company planned to manufacture 1,000 trucks per year and 300 lightweight delivery cars, plus a five-passenger coupe, but it made a total of only 48 vehicles. After Steinmetz died in 1923, the company soon ceased operation.Steinmetz wasn’t only bullish on the electric car, but on electricity in general. A New York Times article recorded his belief that by 2023, we would work no more than 4 hours a day, 200 days a year because electricity would have eliminated the drudgery and unpleasantness of labor. He also predicted that electricity would bring about an end to urban pollution: “Every city would be a spotless town.” With an expansion of leisure time, people would be healthier, engaging in gardening (especially growing their own food) and pursuing educational interests to become “much more intelligent and self-expressive creature[s].”Steinmetz’s Chosen FamilyI decided to write about Steinmetz last year, after IEEE Spectrum published an essay I wrote about why engineering needs the humanities. The article contains this line: “In 1909, none other than Charles Proteus Steinmetz advocated for including the classics in engineering education.” I had been impressed to learn of Steinmetz’s recognition of the value of a liberal arts education. But my copy editor didn’t know who Steinmetz was or why he merited the qualifier “none other.” More people should know about this remarkable man, I decided. And so I went looking for a museum object associated with him, so I could include him in a Past Forward column.  Steinmetz [left] was easily the intellectual equal of Thomas Edison [right], whom he considered a friend.Corbis/Getty ImagesThe electric car is only one avenue into Steinmetz’s life. I could instead have looked into Steinmetz solids (the geometric shapes that form when two or three identical cylinders intersect at right angles), Steinmetz curves (the edges of a Steinmetz solid), or the Steinmetz equivalent circuit (a mathematical model that describes a transformer using resistors and inductors). But none of those concepts could be easily captured in a picture-worthy object. His love of his electric car, on the other hand, was a fun and fitting entry point for this most unusual engineer.I also saw an opportunity to highlight how Steinmetz became a family man. Steinmetz had dwarfism—he stood just 122 centimeters tall—as well as kyphosis, a severe curvature of the spine, as did his father and grandfather. He didn’t wish to pass along those traits, and so he never married or had children of his own. But that didn’t mean he didn’t want a family.In 1903, Steinmetz’s favorite lab assistant, Joseph LeRoy Hayden, told his boss that he was getting married. Steinmetz invited the couple to dinner, and then invited them to live in his large home. They agreed to this unusual living arrangement, with Corinne Rost Hayden running the household and cooking for her husband and Steinmetz. She forced the men to set aside their work for regular family meals.Eventually, the Hayden family expanded, welcoming Joe, Midge, and Billy. Steinmetz legally adopted the elder Hayden, thereby gaining three grandchildren as well. Steinmetz, whom The New York Times had named a “modern Jove” who “hurls thunderbolts at will” (from a high-voltage lightning generator), delighted at entertaining the grandkids with wondrous tricks of electricity and chemistry.In writing about the history of electrical engineering, I sometimes fall into the trap of focusing too much on the technology. But it’s just as important to recognize the people behind the technology—their personalities, their frailties, their feelings, their challenges. Steinmetz faced adversity for his political beliefs, for being an immigrant, and for his physical stature, yet none of that ever stopped him. In word and deed, he showed that he had a generous heart as mighty as his intellect.Part of a continuing series looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology.An abridged version of this article appears in the March 2026 print issue as “Charles Proteus Steinmetz Loved His Electric Car.”ReferencesIEEE Power & Energy Magazine published Steinmetz’s pro/con list comparing electric cars to those with internal combustion engines in the September/October 2005 issue, along with a good biographical overview of Steinmetz by Carl Sulzberger.Union College published a nice story about the restoration of Steinmetz’s electric car in 2014, when it received its permanent home on campus.There are many biographies of Steinmetz, one published as early as 1924, but I am particularly fond of Steinmetz: Engineer and Socialist by Ronald Kline (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992).Gilbert King’s 2011 article “Charles Proteus Steinmetz, the Wizard of Schenectady” for Smithsonian magazine describes Steinmetz’s chosen family and includes several fun anecdotes not mentioned above.",
