advances.\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9gj1w2kn1o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/25/japan-missiles-yonaguni-island-near-taiwan-2031-defence-minister\nhttps://apnews.com/article/mexico-jalisco-cartel-mencho-killed-tapalpa-b12ed518d44951c7875bfddef1c2c7b4\nhttps://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-anniversary-87940e37c2f010572402640c8c5ac78c\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/0c6b63b6-2524-4ba7-9f7a-e7183b29386f\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/25/sri-lankas-former-intelligence-chief-arrested-over-2019-easter-attacks?traffic_source=rss\n\nGeopolitics & Diplomacy\n• Germany’s chancellor Friedrich Merz began his first China trip, arguing against “decoupling” while seeking to rebalance trade and meet Xi Jinping. \n• Trump’s State of the Union

(Mads Claus Rasmussen/Ritzau Scanpix via AP)2026-02-24T08:56:11Z\n                                        KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — More than a dozen senior European officials arrived in the Ukrainian capital on Tuesday in a show of support on the fourth anniversary of Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine — a grim anniversary in a war that has killed tens of thousands of people and put European leaders on edge about the scale of Moscow’s ambitions on the continent.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country has withstood the onslaught by Russia’s bigger and better equipped army, which over the past year of fighting captured just 0.79% of Ukraine’s territory, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank.“Looking back at the beginning of the invasion and reflecting on today, we have every right to say: we have defended our independence, we have not lost our statehood,” Zelenskyy said on social media, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin has “not achieved his goals.”\n    \n        \n    \n\n“He has not broken Ukrainians; he has not won this war,” Zelenskyy also said.However, as the corrosive war of attrition enters its fifth year, a U.S.-led diplomatic push to end Europe’s biggest armed conflict since World War II appears no closer to finding compromises that might make a peace deal possible.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nNegotiations are stuck on what happens to the Donbas, eastern Ukraine’s industrial heartland which Russian forces mostly occupy but have failed to seize completely, and the terms of a postwar security arrangement that Kyiv is demanding to deter any future Russian invasion.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe number of soldiers killed, injured or missing on both sides could reach 2 million by spring, with Russia sustaining the largest number of troop deaths for any major power in any conflict since World War II, a report last month from the Center for Strategic and International Studies estimated.European leaders see their countries’ own security at stake in Ukraine amid concerns about Putin’s wider goals and has demanded its leaders be consulted in the ongoing U.S.-brokered talks.\n    \n        \n    \n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz wrote on X that “for four years, every day and every night has been a nightmare for the Ukrainians — and not just for them, but for us all. Because war is back in Europe.”“We will only end it by being strong together, because the fate of Ukraine is our fate,” he added.The war has drawn in countries far beyond Ukraine, giving the conflict a global dimension, and threatened to worsen shortages, hunger and political instability in developing countries.While NATO countries have come to Ukraine’s aid, Russia has been helped by North Korea, which has sent troops and artillery shells; Iran, which has provided drone technology; and China, which the United States and analysts say has provided machine tools and chips.Among the European officials visiting Kyiv on Tuesday were the President of the European Council, Antonio Costa, the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and Finnish President Alexander Stubb, as well as seven prime ministers and three foreign ministers.\n    \n        \n    \n\nWith Ukraine unable to sustain its fight against Russia without foreign help, NATO countries are now providing military help, purchasing American weapons after the Trump administration broke with earlier Washington policy and stopped giving arms to Kyiv.The European Union has also sent financial aid, but has sometimes met with reluctance from members Hungary and Slovakia.British Armed Forces Minister Al Carns said Russia’s war on Ukraine was “the most defining conflict” in decades.“I don’t think anyone of us would be able to guess (when the war started) the scale and size of what has taken place,” he said.The cost of rebuilding war-battered Ukraine would amount to almost $588 billion over the next decade, according to World Bank, the European Commission, the United Nations and the Ukrainian government.That is nearly three times the estimated nominal GDP of Ukraine for last year, they said in a report Monday.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                ILLIA NOVIKOV\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Novikov is an Associated Press reporter covering news in Ukraine since 2022.

        "title": "Hegseth and Anthropic CEO set to meet as debate intensifies over the military’s use of AI",
        "text": "Dario Amodei, CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, attends the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 23, 2025. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber, File)2026-02-24T05:01:52Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth plans to meet Tuesday with the CEO of Anthropic, with the artificial intelligence company the only one of its peers to not supply its technology to a new U.S. military internal network.Anthropic, maker of the chatbot Claude, declined to comment on the meeting but CEO Dario Amodei has made clear his ethical concerns about unchecked government use of AI, including the dangers of fully autonomous armed drones and of AI-assisted mass surveillance that could track dissent.The meeting between Hegseth and Amodei was confirmed by a defense official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.It underscores the debate over AI’s role in national security and concerns about how the technology could be used in high-stakes situations involving lethal force, sensitive information or government surveillance. It also comes as Hegseth has vowed to root out what he calls a “woke culture” in the armed forces.“A powerful AI looking across billions of conversations from millions of people could gauge public sentiment, detect pockets of disloyalty forming, and stamp them out before they grow,” Amodei wrote in an essay last month.\n    \n        \n    \n\nAnthropic is the only AI company approved for classified military networksThe Pentagon announced last summer that it was awarding defense contracts to four AI companies — Anthropic, Google, OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI. Each contract is worth up to $200 million. Anthropic was the first AI company to get approved for classified military networks, where it works with partners like Palantir. The other three companies, for now, are only operating in unclassified environments.By early this year, Hegseth was highlighting only two of them: xAI and Google.The defense secretary said in a January speech at Musk’s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas that he was shrugging off any AI models “that won’t allow you to fight wars.”\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nHegseth said his vision for military AI systems means that they operate “without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,” before adding that the Pentagon’s “AI will not be woke.”\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nIn January, Hegseth said Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok would join the Pentagon network, called GenAI.mil. The announcement came days after Grok — which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk — drew global scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.OpenAI announced in early February that it, too, would join the military’s secure AI platform, enabling service members to use a custom version of ChatGPT for unclassified tasks. \n    \n        \n    \n\nAnthropic calls itself more safety-mindedAnthropic has long pitched itself as the more responsible and safety-minded of the leading AI companies, ever since its founders quit OpenAI to form the startup in 2021.The uncertainty with the Pentagon is putting those intentions to the test, according to Owen Daniels, associate director of analysis and fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology.“Anthropic’s peers, including Meta, Google and xAI, have been willing to comply with the department’s policy on using models for all lawful applications,” Owens said. “So the company’s bargaining power here is limited, and it risks losing influence in the department’s push to adopt AI.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nIn the AI craze that followed the release of ChatGPT, Anthropic closely aligned with President Joe Biden’s administration in volunteering to subject its AI systems to third-party scrutiny to guard against national security risks.Amodei, the CEO, has warned of AI’s potentially catastrophic dangers while rejecting the label that he’s an AI “doomer.” He argued in the January essay that “we are considerably closer to real danger in 2026 than we were in 2023″ but that those risks should be managed in a “realistic, pragmatic manner.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nAnthropic has been at odds with the Trump administrationThis would not be the first time Anthropic’s advocacy for stricter AI safeguards has put it at odds with the Trump administration. Anthropic needled chipmaker Nvidia publicly, criticizing Trump’s proposals to loosen export controls to enable some AI computer chips to be sold in China. The AI company, however, remains a close partner with Nvidia.The Trump administration and Anthropic also have been on opposite sides of a lobbying push to regulate AI in U.S. states.Trump’s top AI adviser, David Sacks, accused Anthropic in October of “running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering.”Sacks made the remarks on X in response to an Anthropic co-founder, Jack Clark, writing about his attempt to balance technological optimism with “appropriate fear” about the steady march toward more capable AI systems.Anthropic hired a number of ex-Biden officials soon after Trump’s return to the White House, but it’s also tried to signal a bipartisan approach. The company recently added Chris Liddell, a former White House official from Trump’s first term, to its board of directors.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe Pentagon-Anthropic debate is reminiscent of an uproar several years ago when some tech workers objected to their companies’ participation in Project Maven, a Pentagon drone surveillance program. While some workers quit over the project and Google itself dropped out, the Pentagon’s reliance on drone surveillance has only increased.Similarly, “the use of AI in military contexts is already a reality and it is not going away,” Owens said. “Some contexts are lower stakes, including for back-office work, but battlefield deployments of AI entail different, higher-stakes risks,” he said, referring to the use of lethal force or weapons like nuclear arms. “Military users are aware of these risks and have been thinking about mitigation for almost a decade.”___O’Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                MATT O’BRIEN\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                O’Brien covers the business of technology and artificial intelligence for The Associated Press.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto",

        "title": "Mexican cartel clashes fuel worries in lead up to FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "Vehicles pass a burned car a day after the Mexican army killed the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as &quot;El Mencho,&quot; in Guadalajara, Mexico, Monday, Feb. 23, 2026. (AP Photo/Marco Ugarte)2026-02-24T05:26:48Z\n                                        TAPALPA, Mexico (AP) — Maria Dolores Aguirre’s family corner store has lived off tourism that has flowed into her charming cobblestoned town of Tapalpa, tucked away in the mountains of Jalisco state.That was until gunshots erupted and helicopters flew overhead as the Mexican army killed the country’s most powerful drug lord, just a few kilometers (miles) from her home.Now, the 50-year-old Aguirre worries that the bloodshed will deal a blow to her livelihood and change towns like hers. It is something many in the western Mexican state are grappling with, from its Pacific Ocean beaches to its capital Guadalajara that will host matches in June for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.“It’s going to affect us. It’s collateral damage,” Aguirre said. “The government is going to have to have a lot of security. … The entire world just saw what happened and, of course, people are going to think twice about coming.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nFighting between the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and Mexican security forces raged on in a number of states Monday, fueling fears among many like Aguirre that there will be more violence to come.\n\nMore than 70 people died in the attempt to capture Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes and its aftermath, authorities said Monday. Known as “El Mencho,” he was the notorious leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, one of the fastest-growing criminal networks in Mexico, known for trafficking fentanyl, methamphetamine and cocaine to the United States and staging brazen attacks against Mexican government officials. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe White House confirmed that the U.S. provided intelligence support to the operation to capture the cartel leader and applauded Mexico’s army for taking down a man who was one of the most wanted criminals in both countries. The U.S. State Department had offered a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to the arrest of “El Mencho.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe death of Oseguera Cervantes came as Mexico’s government has stepped up its offensive against cartels in an effort to meet demands by U.S. President Donald Trump to crack down on criminal groups, threatening to impose more tariffs or take unilateral military action if the country does not show results.Mexico hoped the death of one of the world’s biggest fentanyl traffickers would ease that pressure, but many people were anxious as they waited to see the powerful cartel’s reaction.Oseguera Cervantes died after a shootout with the Mexican military on Sunday. Mexican Defense Secretary Gen. Ricardo Trevilla said Monday that authorities had tracked one of his romantic partners to his hideout in Tapalpa. The cartel leader and two bodyguards fled into a wooded area where they were seriously wounded in a firefight. They were taken into custody and died on the way to Mexico City, Trevilla said.In the aftermath, a sense of unease simmered in tourist towns.The Pacific Ocean resort city of Puerto Vallarta also was hard hit by cartel reprisals, frightening tourists.Steve Perkins, 57, was visiting Puerto Vallarta with his wife Gayle and some friends. They were on their hotel room’s terrace when explosions and black smoke started appearing around the city Sunday morning.\n    \n        \n    \n\nTheir return to Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, was delayed when their flight was canceled Monday and they were rebooked for March 1. Perkins and his wife have been taking annual trips to Puerto Vallarta since 2012 and have always felt safe, until now. He said they don’t plan on returning to Mexico.“There’s a lot of Americans trapped here,” Perkins said.Back in Tapalpa, Aguirre worked next to her son from the small neighborhood shop her family has owned for 50 years. The 15-year-old’s classes were canceled due to the violence. Aguirre said it was unclear who exactly was in control of the area surrounding her: the military or the cartel. The other question on her mind was if this was just a one-off, or if there was more violence to come.“We don’t know if these people (cartel leaders) are permanently here or not,” she said. “If they really did kill this leader, it could be that they fight between each other to win control or see who will lead it.”__AP writer Juan Lozano in Houston contributed to this report.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                MEGAN JANETSKY\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Megan Janetsky covers migration, conflict, human rights and politics in Mexico and Central America for The AP based in Mexico City.

        "text": "U.S. Ambassador to France Charles Kushner gives a news conference marking the 250th birthday of the U.S. in 2026, in Paris, Dec. 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Christophe Ena, File)2026-02-24T08:26:57Z\n                                        PARIS (AP) — France’s spat with the U.S. ambassador to Paris took another turn Tuesday with the French foreign minister saying the top U.S. diplomat in France must respond to a summons and won’t have access to French government officials until he complies. French authorities had summoned Ambassador Charles Kushner — the father of U.S. President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner — for a meeting on Monday evening over comments from the Trump administration that France objected to. French diplomats said Kushner did not show up.Speaking Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot described the failure to attend the meeting as “a surprise” that flew in the face of diplomatic protocol and will dent Charles Kushner’s ability to serve as an ambassador.“It will, naturally, affect his capacity to exercise his mission in our country,” Barrot said, speaking to public broadcaster France Info.\n    \n        \n    \n\nHe said that Kushner “is bringing difficulties on himself. Because for an ambassador to be able to do his job he needs access to members of the government. That’s the basics.” “When these explanations have taken place, then the U.S. ambassador in France will, naturally, regain access to members of the French government,” the minister said.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe U.S. Embassy did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment on Monday and a follow-up request on Tuesday morning also got no immediate reply.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nFrance’s foreign ministry had summoned Kushner over Trump administration tweets relating to the beating death in France of a far-right activist, Quentin Deranque. The 23-year-old student, described as a fervent nationalist, was beaten by a group of people earlier this month in the city of Lyon, in fighting that erupted between far-left and far-right activists. He later died of brain injuries.In a post last week on X, the State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau said “violent radical leftism is on the rise and its role in Quentin Deranque’s death demonstrates the threat it poses to public safety.”The U.S. Embassy in Paris posted the same statement, in French. Barrot said France needs to discuss the comments with Kushner.“We must have an explanation with him,” Barrot said. “We don’t accept that foreign countries can come and interfere, invite themselves, into the national political debate.” \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n                    \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n                    \n    获取更多RSS：https://feedx.net https://feedx.site",

But much of this bluster is based on false and misleading claims — many of which are likely to be a part of the president’s address to the nation.Here’s a look at some of the false and misleading statements Trump has made at recent public appearances.\n    \n        \n    \n\nEconomyTrump often says the U.S. is now “the hottest country anywhere in the world” after years as a “dead country.” The U.S. economy was hardly “dead’’ when Trump returned to office last year. But in his second term, it’s generally performed strongly — after getting off to a bumpy start.In 2024, the last year of Biden’s presidency, U.S. gross domestic product grew 2.8%, adjusted for inflation, faster than any wealthy country in the world except Spain. It also expanded at a healthy rate from 2021 through 2023.GDP shrank for the first time in three years during the first quarter of 2025. Growth rebounded in the second half of the year, but slowed again in the fourth quarter. Annual GDP growth in 2025 was 2.2%.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nA key measure of inflation fell to nearly a five-year low in January. However, according to the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure, it remains elevated as the cost of goods such as furniture, clothes and groceries increase.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nCompanies have also sharply reduced hiring. Employers added just 181,000 jobs in 2025, the fewest — outside a recession — since 2002. Economists blame a range of factors: Uncertainty created by tariffs and artificial intelligence likely caused many firms to hold back on adding workers. And many companies hired like gangbusters in the aftermath of the pandemic and have since decided to forgo creating any new positions.The U.S. stock market did well last year and yet it underperformed many foreign stock markets. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index climbed 17% — a nice gain but short of a 71% surge in South Korea, 29% in Hong Kong, 26% in Japan, 22% in Germany and 21% in the United Kingdom.\n    \n        \n    \n\nInvestmentsTrump has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. has secured up to $18 trillion in investments, but has presented no evidence of such a high number. The figure appears to be exaggerated, highly speculative or both.The White House website offers a far lower number, $9.6 trillion, and that figure appears to include some investment commitments made during the Biden administration.A study published in January raised doubts about whether more than $5 trillion in investment commitments made last year by many of America’s biggest trading partners will actually materialize and questions how it would be spent if it did.\n    \n        \n    \n\nImmigrationA key aspect of the Trump administration’s agenda is curbing illegal immigration, though the president often uses falsehoods to support his arguments.For example, Trump has repeatedly claimed that an influx of immigrants has led to a massive increase in crime. While FBI statistics do not separate out crimes by the immigration status of the assailant, there is no evidence of a spike in crime perpetrated by migrants, either along the U.S.-Mexico border or in cities seeing the greatest influx of migrants, like New York. Studies have found that people living in the U.S. illegally are less likely than native-born Americans to have been arrested for violent, drug and property crimes.The president also frequently references upward of 300,000 migrant children who are allegedly missing. This misrepresents information in an August 2024 report published by the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of the Inspector General, which faulted Immigration and Customs Enforcement for failing to consistently “monitor the location and status of unaccompanied migrant children” once they are released from federal government custody.\n    \n        \n    \n\nEnergyTrump consistently lauds coal as the ideal energy source, calling it “beautiful, clean coal.” The production of coal is cleaner now than it has been historically, but that doesn’t mean it’s clean.Planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions from the coal industry have decreased over the past 30 years, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. And yet United Nations-backed research has found that coal production worldwide still needs to be reduced sharply to address climate change.Along with carbon dioxide, burning coal emits sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that contribute to acid rain, smog and respiratory illnesses, according to the EIA.The president also regularly denigrates wind power, claiming that it is expensive and that windmills kill birds.Onshore wind is one of the cheapest sources of electricity generation, with new wind farms expected to produce energy costing around $30 per megawatt hour, according to July estimates from the Energy Information Administration.Wind turbines, like all infrastructure, can pose a risk to birds. However, the National Audubon Society, which is dedicated to the conservation of birds, thinks developers can manage these risks and climate change is a greater threat.\n    \n        \n    \n\nElectionsIn the lead-up to the 2026 midterms, Trump has taken to repeating the claim that he won the 2020 presidential election.This is a blatant falsehood that has been disproven many times over — the 2020 election was not stolen.Biden’s win has been affirmed through recounts, audits and reviews in the battleground states where Trump disputed his 2020 loss. He and his allies lost dozens of court challenges related to the election, and his own attorney general at the time said there was no widespread fraud that would have altered the results.Biden earned 306 electoral votes to Trump’s 232. He also won over 7 million more popular votes than Trump.Additionally, the president brags that his 2024 win was a “landslide.” But Trump’s margin of victory was not as large as he makes it seem. He won the electoral vote 312 to 226, including all seven swing states, according to the Federal Election Commission. The popular vote, however, was far closer, with Trump receiving 49.8% of the vote with 77,302,580 votes cast to Democrat Kamala Harris’ 75,017,613 votes (48.32%).CrimeTrump takes credit for a significant decrease in violent crime during 2025, claiming the murder rate in the U.S. dropped to its lowest in 125 years. But this is misleading. Crime had already been trending down in recent years. A study released in January by the Independent Council on Criminal Justice, which collected data from 35 U.S. cities on homicides, showed a 21% decrease in the homicide rate from 2024 to 2025. The report noted that when nationwide data for jurisdictions of all sizes is reported by the FBI later this year, there is a strong possibility that homicides in 2025 will drop to about 4.0 per 100,000 residents. That would be the lowest rate ever recorded in law enforcement or public health data going back to 1900. FBI reports for 2023 and 2024 show significant reductions in violent crimes. Crime surged during the coronavirus pandemic, with homicides increasing nearly 30% in 2020 over the previous year, the largest one-year jump since the FBI began keeping records. But violent crime dropped to near pre-pandemic levels around 2022 when Biden was president.The increase in violent crime during the pandemic defied easy explanation, and experts similarly said the historic drop in violence last year defies easy explanation despite elected officials at all levels — both Democrats and Republicans — rushing to claim credit.Foreign policyOne of Trump’s most frequent talking points is he has “solved” eight wars, a statistic that is highly exaggerated. Although he has helped mediate relations among many nations, his impact isn’t as clear-cut as he makes it seem.The conflicts Trump counts among those that he has solved are between Israel and Hamas, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, India and Pakistan, Serbia and Kosovo, Rwanda and Congo, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and Cambodia and Thailand.___Associated Press writers Claudia Lauer in Philadelphia and Josh Boak and Christopher Rugaber in Washington contributed to this report.___Find AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                MELISSA GOLDIN\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Goldin debunks, analyzes and tracks misinformation for The Associated Press.

        "title": "Supreme Court ruling against Trump’s tariffs is unlikely to mean an end to trade policy chaos",
        "text": "Containers are stored in a cargo terminal in Frankfurt, Germany, Monday, Feb. 23, 2026. (AP Photo/Michael Probst)2026-02-24T05:01:05Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court’s stunning rebuke of President Donald Trump’s most sweeping tariffs means he can’t conjure up new import taxes on a whim anymore.But the justices’ ruling on Friday is nonetheless unlikely to ease the uncertainty over Trump’s trade policy that has paralyzed businesses over the past year. “It’s only gotten more complicated for everybody,’’ said trade lawyer Ryan Majerus, partner at King &amp; Spalding and a former U.S. trade official.Vexing questions remain: How will the president use other laws to reconstruct the tariffs the Supreme Court knocked down, and will those attempts withstand legal challenges? What does the decision mean for the trade deals Trump strong-armed other countries into accepting, using his now-defunct tariffs as leverage? Can importers collect refunds for the tariffs they paid last year, and if so, how?\n    \n        \n    \n\nThen there’s Trump’s own unpredictability. Even though he had weeks to prepare for an unfavorable Supreme Court ruling, his response was still chaotic: On Friday, he said he’d use other legal authority to impose 10% levies on imports from other countries. Saturday, he ratcheted it up to 15%.Normally, lower tariffs arising from the Supreme Court’s decision might be expected to give the economy a little lift. But “any benefit you would get from that is more than offset to a modest negative from the uncertainty front,” said Mike Skordeles, head of U.S. economics at Truist, a bank.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nTrump looks for new import taxesGone for good are the sweeping tariffs Trump justified under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), mainly to combat America’s persistent trade deficits. But that doesn’t mean the president can’t invoke other laws to rebuild much of his tariff wall around the U.S. economy. “Tariff revenues will be unchanged this year and will be unchanged in the future,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Fox News interview Sunday.Trump reached for a stop-gap option immediately after his defeat Friday at the Supreme Court: Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the president to impose tariffs of up to 15% for up to 150 days. But any extension beyond 150 days must be approved by a Congress likely to balk at passing a tax increase as November’s midterm elections loom.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nSection 122 has never been invoked before, and some critics say the president can’t use it as a stand-in for the IEEPA tariffs to combat the trade deficit.\n    \n        \n    \n\nBryan Riley of National Taxpayers Union, for example, argues that Section 122 is meant to give the president a tool to fight what it calls “fundamental international payments problems,’’ not the trade deficit.The provision arose from the financial crises that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s when the U.S. dollar was tied to gold. Other countries were dumping dollars in exchange for gold at a set rate, putting alarming downward pressure on the dollar. But the U.S. currency is no longer linked to gold, so Section 122 has been “effectively rendered obsolete,’’ Riley wrote in a commentary.“Given the amount of money at issue for U.S. businesses, it is not hard to imagine a new wave of litigation attacking Section 122, and again seeking refunds of Section 122 duties collected,” said trade lawyer Dave Townsend, a partner at Dorsey &amp; Whitney.\n    \n        \n    \n\nA sturdier alternative is Section 301 of the same 1974 trade act, which gives the United States a handy cudgel with which to smack countries it accuses of engaging in “unjustifiable,” “unreasonable” or “discriminatory” trade practices. In a statement Friday, in fact, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the administration was launching a series of 301 investigations after the loss at the Supreme Court.Trump invoked Section 301 in his first term to impose sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports in a dispute over the sharp-elbowed tactics that Beijing was using to challenge America’s technological dominance. Those tariffs were upheld in court and kept by the Biden administration. “We’re eight years in, and those China tariffs are still here,” King &amp; Spalding’s Majerus said. “They’re sticky tariffs.’’\n    \n        \n    \n\nConfusion surrounds Trump’s trade deals The Supreme Court’s decision also raises questions about the lopsided trade agreements Trump negotiated last year, using the threat of potentially unlimited IEEPA tariffs to squeeze concessions out of U.S. trading partners from the European Union to Japan.Will countries try to back out of their commitments, now that the IEEPA tariff threat is gone?The European Union’s trade deal with Trump is already on hold amid confusion following the Supreme Court’s ruling — and Trump’s decision to respond to it with the 15% Section 122 global tariff.European lawmakers on Monday delayed a vote on ratifying the pact to seek clarification. They are worried that Trump’s new import tax will stack on top of the “most favored nation’’ tariffs the United States charges under pre-existing World Trade Organization rules — and lift U.S. tariffs on EU imports above the 15% the Europeans had agreed to last year. \n    \n        \n    \n\n“A deal is a deal,” said commission spokesman Olof Gill. “So now we are simply saying to the US, it is up to you to clearly show to us what path you are taking to honor the agreement.”Then there’s the United Kingdom, which had reached a deal with Trump last year for 10% tariffs on its exports to the United States. Will they really go to 15%? Still, trade analysts largely expect U.S. trade partners to stick by the deals they reached with Trump last year. For one thing, the United States could wallop them with hefty Section 301 tariffs, which are potentially unlimited, for violating trade agreements.“They’re going to pretty leery of rocking the boat on their deals,” Majerus said. “Violations of trade agreements can be a basis for taking 301 action. So you could see Section 301 become an enforcement mechanism’’ for the United States.“We are confident that all trade agreements negotiated by President Trump will remain in effect,’’ U.S. Trade Representative Greer said in his statement. A messy refund processIn its ruling, the Supreme Court didn’t bother to say what would happen to all the money collected from the IEEPA tariffs, $133 billion as of mid-December. It left the messy issue of refunds to importers — but likely not to consumers — to lower courts and the Customs and Border Protection agency, which collects import taxes. But they’re likely to be overwhelmed — hundreds of companies are already lined up to get their money back — and the refunds could take months or years to be paid.“The whole thing’s going to be a mess,’’ Majerus said.It’s possible that Congress will order Customs to take an “easy ‘one-click’ approach to refunds,’’ wrote strategists Thierry Wizman and Gareth Berry at the investment bank Macquarie. Otherwise, they warned, the Trump administration could “make the refund process as burdensome as possible, requiring every importer to file stacks of paperwork, if not file a lawsuit, to get its money back. That would be costly for businesses.’’___AP Economics Writers Christopher Rugaber in Washington and David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, contributed to this report.",

        "text": "The U .S. Capitol is seen after sunset in Washington, Monday, Feb. 23, 2026, ahead of President Donald Trump&#x27;s State of the Union address. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)2026-02-24T05:03:36Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will use Tuesday’s State of the Union to champion his immigration crackdowns, his slashing of the federal government, his push to preserve widespread tariffs that the Supreme Court just struck down and his ability to direct quick-hit military actions around the world, including in Iran and Venezuela.The Republican hopes he can convince increasingly wary Americans that his policies have improved their lives while ensuring that the U.S. economy is stronger than many believe — and that they should vote for more of the same in November. The balancing act of celebrating his whirlwind first year back in the White House while making a convincing case for his party in midterm races where he personally won’t be on the ballot is a tall order for any president. But it could prove especially delicate for Trump, given how happy he is to veer off script and ignore carefully crafted messaging. \n    \n        \n    \n\nA main theme will be that the country is booming with a rise in domestic manufacturing and new jobs, despite many Americans not feeling that way. “It’s going to be a long speech because we have so much to talk about,” said Trump, who promised a heavy dose of talk about the economy. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe president is also expected to decry the Supreme Court ruling against his signature tariff policies and talk about his attempts to maneuver around that decision without depending on Congress or spooking financial markets. He’s also likely to urge lawmakers to increase military funding and tighten voter identification requirements, while defending immigration operations that have drawn bipartisan criticism following the shooting deaths of two American citizens. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nJeff Shesol, a former speechwriter for Democratic President Bill Clinton, said Trump has typically used State of the Union addresses to offer more conventional tones than his usual bombast — but he’s still apt to exaggerate repeatedly. \n    \n        \n    \n\n“His job, for the sake of his party, is to show the silver lining,” Shesol said. “But if he’s going to insist that the silver lining is gold, no one’s buying it. And it will be a very difficult position on the campaign trail for Republicans to defend.” Michael Waldman, Clinton’s former chief speechwriter, said second-term presidents “have a tough job because what they all want to say is, ‘Hey, look what a great job I’ve been doing — why don’t you love me?’” Affordability questions loom largeNo matter what his prepared remarks say, Trump relishes deviating into personal grievances, meaning Tuesday will probably feature topics like denying that he lost the 2020 presidential election. His lack of messaging discipline has been on display after concerns about high costs of living helped propel Democratic wins around the country on Election Day last November. The White House subsequently promised that the president would travel the country nearly every week to reassure Americans he was taking affordability seriously. But Trump has spent more time blaming Democrats and scoffing at the notion that kitchen-table issues demand attention. \n    \n        \n    \n\nTrump instead boasts of having tamed inflation and says he has the economy humming given that the Dow Jones Industrial Average recently exceeded 50,000 points for the first time.Such gains don’t feel tangible to those without stock portfolios, however. There also are persistent fears that tariffs stoked higher prices, which could eventually hurt the economy and job creation. Economic growth slowed the last three months of last year. Waldman, now president of the Brennan Center for Justice, which advocates for democracy, civil liberties and fair elections, said previous presidents faced similar instances of “economic disquiet.” That created a question of “how much do you sell vs. feeling the pain of the electorate,” he said. Shesol noted that Trump has “always believed — going back to his real estate days — that he can sell anyone on anything.”“He’s still doing that. But the problem is, you can’t tell somebody who has lost their job and can’t get a new one that things are going great,” Shesol said. “He can’t sell people on a reality that for them, and frankly for most Americans, does not exist.” \n    \n        \n    \n\nIt is potentially politically perilous ahead of November elections that could deliver congressional wins to Democrats, just as 2018’s “blue wave” created a strong check to his administration during his first term. Several Democrats in Congress, meanwhile, plan to skip Tuesday’s speech in protest, instead attending a rally known as the “People’s State of the Union” on Washington’s National Mall. \n    \n        \n    \n\nForeign policy in focusTrump’s address comes as two U.S. aircraft carriers have been dispatched to the Middle East amid tensions with Iran. The president will recount how U.S. airstrikes last summer pounded Tehran’s nuclear capabilities, and laud the raid that ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Nicolás Maduro, as well as his administration’s brokering of a ceasefire in Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza. But he also strained U.S. military alliances with NATO, thanks to his push to seize Greenland from Denmark and his failure to take a harder line with Russian President Vladimir Putin in seeking an end to its war in Ukraine. Making any foreign policy feel relevant to Americans back home is never easy. Jennifer Anju Grossman, a former speechwriter for Republican President George H.W. Bush and current CEO of the Atlas Society, which promotes the ideas of author and philosopher Ayn Rand, said Trump can make clear that Maduro’s socialist policies wrecked Venezuela’s economy to the point where one of the world’s richest oil countries struggled to meet its own energy needs.Now, oil from that country will help lower American gas prices. Still, when it comes to overseas developments, she said, “I think it’s going to be a bit of a challenge to make clear why this is relevant to the domestic situation.” \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                WILL WEISSERT\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Weissert covers the White House for The Associated Press.

        "title": "Wednesday briefing: Is the tide turning against Trump on tariffs?",
        "text": "In today’s newsletter: With the latest supreme court ruling exposing the president’s tariff plans as unlawful, US politicians and the American people have found them to be unworkable. Where does Trump go from here?Good morning. Let’s delve into the two Ts shaping the global economy right now: tariffs and Trump.Last week, the US supreme court ruled that Donald Trump had unlawfully used executive powers to impose sweeping global tariffs. In a 6-3 decision, the court found that the 1977 law Trump relied on did not give him the authority he claimed to introduce tariffs across the world.

Marking her first show in Japan in four years, the exhibition explores the concept of transformation as a continuous state of \"becoming\" rather than a singular event.For BECOMING, Oliver uses the visual language of 1960s sports advertisements - characterized by vibrant colors and graphical compositions - to reconstruct modern narratives around identity and selfhood. In this context, sports serve as a metaphor for discipline, repetition, and the internal process of shedding past identities in favor of growth.The exhibition positions sport not as competition but as a metaphor, reflecting themes of discipline, repetition, endurance, collapse, and renewal. Each artwork captures the invisible effort preceding meaningful change, portraying the inner process of shedding past identities. Through striking compositions and refined color palettes, Oliver’s pieces embody both strength and fragility, offering viewers a contemplative space to reflect on transformation as an ongoing state rather than a singular event.BECOMING will run from March 5 - 28, 2026, at GALLERY TARGET and is complemented by a collaboration with Coffee Supreme, offering limited‑edition tote bags and drip coffee sets that further extend the exhibition’s themes into everyday culture.GALLERY TARGET Tokyo5 Chome-9-25 Jingumae,Shibuya, Tokyo 150-0001, JapanClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "SummaryArtist Barry McGee, Jeffrey Deitch and The Hole present 99CENT, a massive installation at a shuttered discount store, for Los Angeles Art WeekRunning through March 1, the show brings together an eclectic showcase from over 100 artists, spanning painting, sculpture, illustration and performanceArt Week is gaining momentum in Los Angeles as visitors from the around the globe descend on the City of Angels for a packed itinerary, hitting marquee events like Frieze, Felix Art Fair, Post-Fair and the inaugural edition of Enzo. Just a block down from LACMA at 6121 Wilshire Boulevard, however, an alternative “anti-fair” crowd brews. To set the scene, just imagine: 100 artists walk into a 99 cent store.In the two days since opening, the aptly titled 99CENT has quickly made its way to the top of this week's must-see's. Organized by Barry McGee in collaboration with The Hole and Jeffrey Deitch, the project transforms a shuttered discount shop into a lively artist flea, filling the space from floor to ceiling with over 4,000 works.Much of the store's physical character remains intact — original signage, refrigerators, shopping charts. Its 20,000 square feet of scuffed linoleum floors. The presentation itself is tastefully unruly, embracing a DIY sensibility that plays to the history of the space rather than erasing it.Mounted throughout the store's aisles, walls and ceilings are McGee originals, pieces from his personal collection and contributions from over 100 West Coast artists and otherwise, including KATSU, Chito, Ruben Preciado, Gary Baseman, Tom Franco, Lauryn Halsey and many more. Alongside the installation, 99CENT will culminate in an Anti-Fascist Zine Fair at The Hole on Sunday, closing out Art Week with “artist healing center and community hangout zone,” Deitch described. Visitors can expect live music and performances.McGee, now a blue chip artist, pays homage to his tagging roots in a lively celebration of street art and outsider aesthetics, disrupting the week's commercial thrum with a much-needed return to the human side of creative exchange.99CENT is now on view at 6121 Wilshire in Los Angeles through March 1.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

Challenges faced by Milano Cortina 2026 organisers such as producing artificial snow, establishing transport links between remote locations and building new infrastructure are likely to become more omnipresent at future editions.In response to a petition asking the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to prevent fossil fuel companies from sponsoring winter sports, the IOC president, Kirsty Coventry, said the governing body is “having conversations in order to be better” in its approach to climate change. A New Weather Institute report estimated that the fossil fuel giant Eni, carmaker Stellantis and ITA Airways sponsoring Milano Cortina 2026 will induce an additional 40% to the Games’ carbon footprint, enough to melt 3.2 square km of snow cover and 20 million tonnes of glacier ice.

        "title": "This Physics Professor Credits Collaboration for Her Success",
        "text": "For Cinzia DaVià, collaboration isn’t just a buzzword. It’s the approach she applies to all her professional endeavors.From her contributions to the development of a silicon sensor used in CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) particle accelerator experiments to her current research on portable energy generation solutions, there’s a common thread.Cinzia DaViàEmployers University of Manchester, England;Stony Brook University, in New YorkJob titles Professor of physics; research professorMember grade Senior memberAlma maters University of Bologna, Italy; University of GlasgowAs a professor of physics at the University of Manchester, in England, and a research professor at Stony Brook University, in New York, she has built strong connections across academic disciplines. Her continued involvement at CERN connects her with a broad array of professionals.DaVià, an IEEE senior member, says she leverages her expertise and her network of collaborators to solve problems and build solutions. Her efforts include advancing high-energy particle experiments, improving cancer treatments, and mitigating the effects of climate change.Collaboration is the foundation for any project’s success, she says. She credits IEEE for making many of her professional connections possible.Even though she is the driving force behind building her alliances, she prefers to shine the spotlight on others, she says. For her, focusing on teamwork is more important than identifying individual contributions.“The people involved in any project are really the ones to be celebrated,” she says. “The focus should be on them, not me.”A career influenced by Italian televisionAs a young child growing up in the Italian Dolomites, her passion for physics was sparked by a popular documentary series, “Astronomia,” an Italian version of Carl Sagan’s renowned “Cosmos” series. The show was DaVià’s introduction to the world of astrophysics. She enrolled at Italy’s Alma Mater Studiorum/University of Bologna, confident she would pursue a degree in astronomy and astrophysics.A summer internship at CERN in Geneva changed her career trajectory. She helped construct experiments for the Large Electron-Positron collider there. The LEP remains the largest electron-positron accelerator ever. An underground tunnel wide enough to accommodate the LEP’s 27-kilometer circumference was built on the CERN campus. It was Europe’s biggest civil engineering project at the time.The LEP was designed to validate the standard model of physics, which until then was a theoretical framework that attempted to explain the universe’s building blocks. The experiments—which performed precision measurements of W and Z bosons, the positive and neutral bits central to particle physics—confirmed the standard model.The LEP also paved the way, figuratively and literally, for CERN’s Large Hadron Collider. Following the LEP’s decommissioning in 2000, it was dismantled to make way for the LHC in the same underground testing tunnel.As DaVià’s summer internship work on LEP experiments progressed, her professional focus shifted. Her plans to work in astrophysics gradually transitioned to a focus on radiation instrumentation.After graduating in 1989 with a physics degree, she returned to CERN for a one-year assignment. As she got more involved in research and development for the large collider experiments, her one year turned into 10.She received a CERN fellowship to help her finish her Ph.D. in physics at the University of Glasgow—which she received in 1997. Her work focused on radiation detectors and their applications in medicine.“Nothing was programmed,” she says of her career trajectory. “It was always an opportunity that came after another opportunity, and things evolved along the way.”A fusion of research and resultsDuring her decade at CERN from 1989 to 1999, she contributed to several groundbreaking discoveries. One involved the radiation hardness of silicon sensors at cryogenic temperatures, referred to in physics as the Lazarus effect.In the world of collider experiments, the silicon sensors function as eyes that capture the first moments of particle creation. The sensors are part of a larger detector unit that takes millions of images per second, helping scientists better understand particle creation.In large collider experiments, the silicon sensors suffer significant damage from the radiation generated. After repeated exposure, the sensors eventually become nonfunctional.DaVià’s contributions helped develop the process of reviving the dead detectors by cooling them down to temperatures below -143° C.Her proudest professional accomplishment, she says, was a different discovery at CERN: Her research helped usher in a new era of large collider experiments.For many years, researchers there used planar silicon sensors in collider experiments. But as the large colliders grew more sophisticated and capable, the traditional planar silicon design couldn’t withstand the extreme radiation present at the epicenter of collider collisions.DaVià’s research contributed to the development, together with inventor Sherwood Parker, of 3D silicon sensors that could withstand extreme radiation.The new sensors are radiation-resistant and exceptionally fast, she says.Scientists began replacing planar sensors in the detectors deployed closest to the center of each collision. Planar detectors are still widely used in collider experiments but farther from direct impacts.The development of the 3D silicon sensor was groundbreaking, but DaVià says she is proud of it for a different reason. The collaborative approach of the cross-functional R&amp;D team she built is the most noteworthy outcome, she says.Initially, people with conservative scientific views resisted the idea of creating a new sensor technology, she says. She was able to bring together a broad coalition of scientists, researchers, and industry leaders to work together, despite the initial skepticism and competing interests. The team included two companies that were direct competitors.That type of industry collaboration was unheard of at the time, she says.“I was able to convince them,” she says, “that working together would be the best and fastest way forward.”Her approach succeeded. The two companies not only worked side by side but also exchanged proprietary information. They went so far as to agree that if something halted progress for one of them, it would ship everything to the other so production could continue.DaVià coauthored a book about the project, Radiation Sensors With 3D Electrodes.A focus on sustainable entrepreneurshipDaVià has long been concerned about the impact of extreme weather events, especially on underserved populations. Her interest transformed into action after she attended the American Institute of Architects International and AIA Japan Osaka World Expo last year.During the symposium, held in June, panelists shared insights about natural disasters in their regions and identified steps that could help mitigate damage and protect lives.The topics that particularly interested DaVià, she says, were excessive glacial melt in the Himalayas and the lack of tsunami warnings on remote Indonesian islands.One of the ideas that surfaced during a brainstorming session was that of “smart shelters” that could be deployed in remote areas to assist in recovery efforts. The shelters would provide power and a means of communication during outages.The concept was inspired by MOVE, an IEEE-USA initiative. The MOVE program provides communities affected by natural disasters with power and communications capabilities. The services are contained within MOVE vehicles and are powered by generators. A single MOVE vehicle can charge up to 100 phones, bolstering communication capabilities for relief agencies and disaster survivors.DaVià’s knowledge of MOVE guided the evolution of the smart shelter concept. She recognized, however, that the challenge of powering portable shelters needed to be solved. She took the lead and formed a cross-disciplinary team of IEEE members and other professionals to make headway. One result is a planned two-day conference on sustainable entrepreneurship to be held at CERN in October.“IEEE helps bring people together who might not otherwise connect.”The goal of the conference, she says, is to “join the dots across different disciplines by involving as many IEEE societies and external experts as possible to work toward deployable solutions that help improve life for people around the world.”The two-day event will include a competition focusing on solutions for sustainable energy generation and storage systems, she says, adding that entrepreneurs will share their ideas on the second day.Her commitment to developing solutions to mitigate destruction caused by extreme weather led to her involvement with the IEEE Online Forum on Climate Change Technologies. She led the way in creating the Climate Change Initiative within the IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society (NPSS).She was the driving force behind securing funding for two of the society’s climate-related events. One was the 2024 Climate Workshop on Nuclear and Plasma Solutions for Energy and Society. The second event, building on the success of the first, was last year’s workshop: Nuclear and Plasma Opportunities for Energy and Society, held in conjunction with the Osaka World Expo.New paths to guide othersDaVià reduced her involvement at CERN, when she joined the faculty at the University of Manchester as a physics professor. In 2016 she joined Stony Brook University as a research professor in the physics and astronomy department. She divides her time between the two schools.She still maintains an office at CERN, where she works with students involved with particle physics.

        "title": "Your Watch Will One Day Track Blood Pressure",
        "text": "Your smartwatch can track a lot of things, but at least for now, it can’t keep an accurate eye on your blood pressure. Last week researchers from University of Texas at Austin showed a way you smartwatch someday could. They were able to discern blood pressure by reflecting radio signals off a person’s wrist, and they plan to integrate the electronics that did it into a smartwatch in a couple of years.Beside the tried-and-true blood pressure cuff, researchers in general have found several new ways to monitor blood pressure using pasted-on ultrasound transducers, electrocardiogram sensors, bioimpedance measurements, photoplethysmography, and combinations of these measurements.“We found that existing methods all face limitations,” Yiming Han, a doctoral candidate in the lab of Yaoyao Jia told engineers at the IEEE International Solid State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) last week in San Francisco. For example, ultrasound sensing requires long-term contact with the skin. And as cool as electronic tattoos seem, they’re not as convenient or comfortable as a smartwatch. Photoplethysmography, which detects the oxygenation state of blood using light, doesn’t need direct contact, and indeed researchers in Tehran and California recently used it and a heavy dose of machine learning to monitor blood pressure. However, these sensors are thought to be sensitive to a person’s skin tone and were blamed for Black people in the United States getting inadequate treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.The University of Texas team sought a non-contact solution that was immune to skin-tone bias and could be integrated into a small device.Continuous Blood Pressure MonitoringBlood pressure measurements consist of two readings—systole, the peak pressure when the heart contracts and forces blood into arteries, and diastole, the phase in between heart contractions when pressure drops. During systole, blood vessels expand and stiffen and blood velocity increases. The opposite occurs in diastole.All these changes alter conductivity, dielectric properties, and other tissue properties, so they should show up in reflected near-field radio waves, Jia’s colleague Deji Akinwande reasoned. Near-field waves are radiation impacting a surface that is less than one wavelength from the radiation’s source.The researchers were able to test this idea using a common laboratory instrument called a vector network analyzer. Among its abilities, the analyzer can sense RF reflection, and the team was able to quickly correlate the radio response to blood pressure measured using standard medical equipment.What Akinwande and Jia’s team saw was this: During systole, reflected near-field waves were more strongly out of phase with the transmitted radiation, while in diastole the reflections were weaker and closer to being in phase with the transmission.You obviously can’t lug around a US $50,000 analyzer just to keep track of your blood pressure, so the team created a wearable system to do the job. It consists of a patch antenna strapped to a person’s wrist. The antenna connects to a device called a circulator—a kind of traffic roundabout for radio signals that steers outgoing signals to the antenna and signals coming in from the antenna to a separate circuit. A custom-designed integrated circuit feeds a 2.4 gigahertz microwave signal into one of the circulator’s on-ramps and receives, amplifies, and digitizes the much weaker reflection coming in from another branch. The whole system consumes just 3.4 milliwatts.“Our work is the only one to provide no skin contact and no skin-tone bias,” Han said.The next version of the device will use multiple radio frequencies to increase accuracy, says Jia, “because different people’s tissue conditions are different” and some might respond better to one or another. Like the 2.4 gigahertz used in the prototype these other frequencies will be of the sort already in common use such as 5 GHz (a Wi-Fi frequency) and 915 megahertz (a cellular frequency).Following those experiments, Jia’s team will turn to building the device into a smartwatch form factor and testing them more broadly for possible commercialization.",

Part of the problem is that autophagy to clear out damaged mitochondria becomes less effective. Here researchers show that the distribution of mitochondria in neurons is important to the operation of autophagy and mitochondrial function. Unlike other cells, neurons have very long projections, the axons, that require a sufficiently large population of localized mitochondria for correct function. Aging impairs the mechanisms involved in ensuring that axons are sufficiently supplied with mitochondria, and this in turn impairs function in the brain. Neuronal aging and neurodegenerative diseases are accompanied by proteostasis collapse, while the cellular factors that trigger it have not been identified.

With age, this production of cells becomes dysfunctional in a variety of ways, contributing to the aging of the immune system. For example, production of immune cells becomes biased to myeloid cells at the expense of lymphoid cells, a change that contributes indirectly to the more inflammatory behavior of the aged immune system. Identifying specific mechanisms involved in hemotopoietic aging is the first step on the road to finding ways to reverse these issues. Aged hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) show diminished capacity of self-renewal, skewed lineage output and compromised proteostasis.

To date, the protective mechanisms against inflammaging are poorly defined. Here, we identify DNA-PK-mediated phosphorylation of murine STAT6 at serine 807 (Ser807) as a crucial post-translational modification for preventing macrophage senescence. Ser807 phosphorylation blocks STAT6 ubiquitination-mediated degradation and promotes STAT6 partnering with PU.1 to activate DNA repair genes. Macrophages lacking Ser807 phosphorylation exhibit DNA repair defects, undergo senescence, and fuel inflammaging. In vivo, the phosphor-null STAT6 mutant (STAT6(S807A)) accelerates macrophage senescence, tissue fibrosis, and systemic aging. Adoptive transfer of phosphomimetic STAT6(S807E)-expressing macrophages rescues accelerated aging. Importantly, phosphorylation of human STAT6 at the homologous residue (Ser817) is significantly reduced in the lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), correlating with increased DNA damage and senescence. Thus, our findings reveal a DNA-PK-STAT6 axis enacting a non-canonical type 2 immunity via DNA repair to prevent macrophage senescence, presenting a therapeutic target for healthy aging.\n                \n                Longevity Relevance Analysis\n                The paper claims that DNA-PK-mediated phosphorylation of STAT6 prevents macrophage senescence and thus mitigates inflammaging.

Here we found that the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), activated by JNK signaling in aging guts, transcriptionally suppresses peptidoglycan recognition protein SC2(PGRP-SC2)-a homolog of anti-inflammatory PGLYRP1-4 with amidase activity. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that CREB modulates not only microbial load but also microbiota composition. Elevated CREB activity decreased the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio-a hallmark of age-associated dysbiosis in animals. Genetic enhancement of PGRP-SC2 rescues age-related gut hyperplasia, microbiota imbalance, and lifespan shortening induced by overactivation of CREB or its coactivator CRTC. Notably, CREB&apos;s regulation of PGRP-SC2 operates independently of canonical immune pathways such as Imd/Relish, revealing a previously unrecognized layer of immune modulation. Our findings establish CREB as a central player in age-associated immune dysregulation and propose targeting the CREB-PGRP-SC2 axis as a potential therapeutic strategy for mitigating gut aging and its systemic consequences.\n                \n                Longevity Relevance Analysis\n                CREB regulates immune senescence and gut dysbiosis through the suppression of PGRP-SC2, impacting aging and longevity.

The classic sneaker replaces traditional Tuned Air branding with custom \"KM Air\" badges on the tongue and footbed.The performance-focused Mercurial Superfly 10 cleats perfectly mirror this energy, sporting a brownish-taupe base heavily contrasted by a bright lime green Swoosh and silver pill-shaped graphics extending from the heel.

When paired with the eze dolly, the crate becomes mobile, offering seamless movement without compromising stability. This integration of utility and design reflects Toneoptic’s commitment to rethinking everyday tools for vinyl enthusiasts.Material options further distinguish the Can Record Crate. Buyers can choose from semi‑matte black, gloss white, post‑consumer recycled aluminum, North American white oak, or American black walnut, each complemented by transparent or signature “can blue” accents. These finishes allow collectors to personalize their storage system, aligning with both sustainability and premium craftsmanship. The thoughtful material palette ensures the crate adapts to diverse interior styles, from minimalist modern spaces to warm, wood‑toned environments.Available for pre‑sale starting February 26 with prices starting at $195 USD.

        "title": "Glenn Martens Curates a Garden of Earthly Delights for Diesel FW26",
        "text": "SummaryGlenn Martens’ Diesel FW26 collection was presented in a surreal \"garden\" of 50,000 memorabilia objects, featuring Diesel signatures like creased denim and grungey knitwear.The show balanced meticulous fabric manipulation, like \"fire-streaked\" furs and glowing seams, with wearable, commercial appeal, solidifying Martens’ mastery of the brand.On Tuesday afternoon, Glenn Martens presented his Diesel FW26 collection in Milan, inviting guests into a space centered around more than 50,000 objects and props from the Diesel universe.Resembling a postmodern version of Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights, the collection reflected the colorful, hedonistic, and maximalist style of the iconic painting through Martens’ pop-art-inspired aesthetic. Wearing sculptural, scrunched denim and neon-tinged numbers, the models made their way through a \"garden\" of objects featuring life-size figurines—ranging from polar bears to aliens and Santa Claus. Outsized inflatables, plants, and even a car were scattered among pieces of clothing and jewelry. View this post on InstagramA post shared by Diesel (@diesel) The presentation began with denim and knitwear-focused looks: classic Diesel jeans were washed and creased, while jersey basics and knitted sweaters were scrunched into amorphous tops. A unique recycled felt fabric resembling insulation was tailored into sartorial pieces, including an overcoat and a two-piece suit. Touches of whimsy, including bursting florals and lustrous organza fabrics, were juxtaposed with Diesel’s grungier expression: ripped tees, flocked denim, faded graphic shirts, and plaid skirts wrapped at the waist like flannel shirting.Fur has had a major presence throughout the FW26 collections, and Martens quite literally carried the torch into Milan Fashion Week. Gray fur coats and tops boasted bright orange, red, and blue streaks, making the garments look as if they had been set on fire as they caught the wind on the runway. Later, sheer tops and embellished denim appeared to glow from within, bleeding pink and turquoise from the seams and creases.The show closed with a run of pastel-hued leather jackets and laminated jeans in baby blue, pink, yellow, and orange. The final looks deconstructed contemporary womenswear, combining spliced floral fabrics with high-contrast pleats and reworking them with signature creasing.Despite the display of excess, the collection was far from kitsch. Instead, it continued to showcase the artful approach Martens has cultivated during his five-year tenure at the Italian label. With one foot in the avant-garde at Maison Margiela and clearly influenced by his former leadership at Y/Project, the designer proved once again that he is a master of surreal fabric manipulation. As demonstrated in previous seasons, Martens successfully balanced awe-inspiring spectacle with pieces that remain essentially wearable.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",
