It said the assailant approached a traffic police vehicle and detonated an explosive device, killing an officer on the spot and injuring two others, who were hospitalized.Russia’s Investigative Committee said it has launched a probe into the attack. It didn’t name the assailant or give any information about his possible motives or any further details.The attack came on the day marking the fourth anniversary of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to send troops into Ukraine.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n                    \n    获取更多RSS：https://feedx.net https://feedx.site",

        "text": "A vehicle blocks access to a property in Cameron, N.C., Sunday, Feb. 22, 2026. (AP Photo/Allen G. Breed)2026-02-23T16:05:50Z\n                                        CAMERON, N.C. (AP) — The 21-year-old North Carolina man who drove through a gate at President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort with a shotgun before he was shot and killed worked as a golf course groundskeeper and liked to sketch.Austin Tucker Martin rarely, if ever, talked about politics, seemed afraid of guns, and came from a family of Trump supporters, according to Braeden Fields, a cousin who said the two grew up together. “I wouldn’t believe he would do something like this. It’s mind-blowing,” Fields said. “He wouldn’t even hurt an ant. He doesn’t even know how to use a gun.”Martin drove into the secure perimeter at Mar-a-Lago early Sunday and raised a shotgun at two Secret Service agents and a Palm Beach County sheriff’s deputy who then opened fire “to neutralize the threat,” said Sheriff Ric Bradshaw.Trump, who often spends weekends at the Palm Beach, Florida, resort, was at the White House at the time.\n    \n        \n    \n\nInvestigators have not identified a motive. Trump faced two assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including one just a few miles (kilometers) from Mar-a-Lago when a man was spotted aiming a rifle through shrubbery while Trump was golfing.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nFollowing Sunday’s incident, Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said investigators believe Martin bought his shotgun while driving to Florida. Authorities said his family had recently reported him missing. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nMartin was from central North Carolina, where guns and hunting are a part of life, his cousin said. But whenever they’d go hunting or target shooting, Martin would never pick up a gun, Fields told The Associated Press on Sunday.He lived with his mother in a modest modular house down a rutted sandy road near the town of Cameron. No one answered the door Monday, and the large police presence from the day before was gone.Martin’s sister was killed in a car accident a few years ago and he has an older brother who’s in the military, Fields said.\n    \n        \n    \n\nFor the past three years, Martin worked as a groundskeeper at Pine Needles Lodge &amp; Golf Club.“It’s tragic. I feel for his family,” said Kelly Miller, president of the course in nearby Southern Pines. “It’s just unfortunate what transpired. It was totally unexpected.”Martin last year started a business to sell pen drawings he made, according to state records. A website matching the company name features illustrations of golf courses, buildings and ancient Roman architecture.Politics didn’t seem to be among his interests, his cousin said“We are big Trump supporters, all of us. Everybody,” Fields said, but his cousin was “real quiet, never really talked about anything.”___Associated Press reporters Michelle L.

Today marks four years since Russian tanks first rolled towards Kyiv as Vladimir Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine – a war he insisted on calling a “special military operation”. The initial assault was repelled, almost certainly to his surprise, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government remained intact to marshal the nation’s defences.What followed has been widely perceived as a grinding war of attrition. While Russia has made incremental advances across territory it had already destabilised through Moscow-backed separatist republics, Ukraine has been subjected to a relentless aerial assault on its infrastructure – one that western support, from sanctions to air-defence systems and fighter jets, has not been able to halt. Peace initiatives – with varying degrees of sincerity – have come and gone.Peter Mandelson| Peter Mandelson has been arrested and released on bail by detectives investigating claims he committed misconduct in public office during his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.Education | Hundreds of thousands fewer children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) will be given education, health and care plans (EHCPs) as a result of long-awaited changes announced by the education secretary.UK politics | Reform UK’s plan to create an ICE-style deportation agency has been condemned as “sadistic”, after the party’s home affairs spokesperson vowed to face down “progressive outrage”.Media | The BBC has issued a new apology for its handling of an incident at the Bafta film awards which saw the N-word broadcast during BBC One coverage of the ceremony and remain overnight on BBC iPlayer.Iran | Donald Trump’s decision to order airstrikes against Iran will hinge in part on the judgment of Trump’s special envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.

        "text": "With the Russian military performing poorly, Ukraine is clarifying strategy and pushing back with modest successRussia’s invasion of Ukraine, now entering its fifth grim year, has already gone on longer than the entire fight on the eastern front in the second world war. The Soviets marched from the gates of Leningrad to Berlin in a little over 15 months in 1944-45; today the Russian rate of gain in Pokrovsk in Ukraine is 70 metres a day, in Kupiansk, 23 metres, according to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.The gains are trivial, given Ukraine’s size, amounting to 1,865 sq miles during 2025 (about 0.8% of the country) – so the idea touted by the Russians, sometimes accepted by a credulous White House, that Ukraine is suffering a slow-motion defeat, is not accurate. In reality, even allowing for the fact that hundreds of thousands of homes are without electricity, heating and water after Russian bombing, Ukraine is clarifying its strategy and pushing back with modest success.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, file)2026-02-23T16:32:46Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal health officials on Monday laid out a proposal to spur development of customized treatments for patients with hard-to-treat diseases, including for rare genetic conditions that the pharmaceutical industry has long considered unprofitable.The preliminary Food and Drug Administration guidelines, if implemented, would create a new pathway for bespoke therapies that have only been tested in a handful of patients due to the challenges of conducting larger studies. The FDA announcement specifically mentions gene editing, although agency officials said the new approach could also be used by other drugs and therapies.It’s a shift long sought by patients, advocates and researchers focused on rare diseases, which often do not fit within the pharmaceutical industry’s business model or the FDA’s traditional drug-approval system.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“It is our priority to remove barriers and exercise regulatory flexibility to encourage scientific advances and deliver more cures and meaningful treatments for patients suffering from rare diseases,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in a release.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe announcement comes a week after Makary said the FDA would drop its decades-old standard of requiring two clinical trials for standard drug reviews. That was the latest in a series of changes to FDA norms and standards, many which have not gone through federal procedures traditionally used to update agency rules.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nSenior FDA officials said the recent changes, including the pathway proposed Monday, don’t constitute new FDA standards. The FDA will take comments on its draft guidance for 60 days, before beginning to finalize it.In recent years, academic researchers have shown they can use emerging technology to correct individual defects in a patient’s genetic code. Last year, a team at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania designed a therapy using CRISPR, the Nobel Prize-winning gene editing tool, to treat a baby born with a rare disease that causes ammonia to build up in the blood.\n    \n        \n    \n\nTraditionally, the FDA requires drugmakers to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of their experimental treatments in clinical studies that compare a set of patients getting the therapy with others taking a sham treatment or an alternative intervention. The more patients enrolled, the stronger the evidence.But for conditions that can affect a tiny fraction of people worldwide, drug companies often have little incentive to invest millions of dollars needed to complete a study and bring it through the FDA approval process, which can take a decade or longer.The pathway announced Monday would create a standardized process for authorizing experimental treatments and, importantly, offering companies the possibility of commercializing them.The FDA already authorizes the use of experimental drugs under what’s called “compassionate use,” for people with no other medical options. But the process is cumbersome to navigate and strictly prohibits companies or researchers from profiting from treatments that haven’t been vetted by the FDA.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe new pathway’s name — plausible mechanism — is a reference to criteria FDA regulators will require before greenlighting any experimental therapies. FDA officials say the approach will be reserved for conditions that are well understood and where there is a plausible reason to think that the therapy will act on the underlying genetic or cellular biology of the disease. Researchers must also confirm that the therapy successfully targeted the patient’s genetic or biological abnormality.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

        "text": "A pedestrian walks along 42nd Street near Bryant Park during a snow storm, Monday, Feb. 23, 2026, in New York. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)2026-02-24T05:34:22Z\n                                        NEW YORK (AP) — Neighbors, government workers and a powerful railroad snow-clearing machine nicknamed “Darth Vader” scrambled to dig out much of the northeastern United States from a brutal and — in some areas — record-breaking storm that blanketed the region with snow and resulted in thousands of flight cancellations.But as the snow moved northward and tapered off in other areas Tuesday, forecasters warned that another storm could be right around the corner.Monday’s storm that meteorologists are calling the strongest in a decade dumped more than 2 feet (61 centimeters) of snow in parts of the Northeast. By Tuesday, roads were beginning to reopen, mass transportation was coming back online in some cities and power had returned for some of the hundreds of thousands who had lost electricity in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Delaware and Rhode Island.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIn New York City, which canceled classed Monday, Mayor Zohran Mamdani announced that schools would reopen for in person learning on Tuesday, raising questions about how feasible that is with snow still piled along sidewalks.Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella said school should remain closed, while Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, described the situation as “a big mess.”\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n“There’s going to be low attendance of students. You’re going to have low attendance of staff because people don’t know if they can travel, if they can get to schools,” he said.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nSpokespersons for Mamdani didn’t respond to an email seeking comment but his schools chief, Chancellor Kamar Samuels, said in a post on X, that they were “confident in our decision to reopen.”Philadelphia switched to online learning Monday and Tuesday. Districts on Long Island and elsewhere in the New York suburbs said they would cancel school again Tuesday.The National Weather Service said it’s tracking another storm that could bring more snow to the region later this week. \n    \n        \n    \n\nWhile the new storm is not expected to be as strong, even a few extra inches of snow on top of hard-hit areas could make cleanup more difficult, said Frank Pereira, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland.“Any additional snow at this point is probably not going to be welcome,” he said.The weather service referred to Monday’s storm as a “classic bomb cyclone/nor’easter off the Northeast coast.” A bomb cyclone happens when a storm’s pressure falls by a certain amount within a 24-hour period, occurring mainly in the fall and winter when frigid Arctic air can reach the south and clash with warmer temperatures.More than 2,000 flights in and out of the United States were canceled Tuesday, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. Most of the cancellations involved airports in New York, New Jersey and Boston. Rhode Island’s T.F. Green International Airport paused its airport operations Monday as it dealt with nearly 38 inches (97 centimeters) of snow, according to the Weather Service, breaking a record set in 1978. Central Park in New York City recorded 19 inches (48 centimeters) of snow. Warwick, Rhode Island, exceeded 3 feet (91 centimeters), topping the nation so far. The highest wind gust of 83 mph (134 kph) was recorded in Nantucket, with hurricane-force gusts seen all over Cape Cod.\n    \n        \n    \n\nNew York, Philadelphia and other cities, as well as several states, declared emergencies. The Boston Globe management called off printing its daily newspaper for the first time in its more than 150-year history because snow and winds kept staff from safely getting to its printing plant, the newspaper said in an article on its website.In the New York City-area, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said Monday evening that subway lines are mostly operational after earlier delays, with the exception of the hard-hit borough of Staten Island, where rail service remained suspended. Commuter rail service to suburbs to the north and east of the city were expected to resume limited service ahead of the Tuesday morning commute, the MTA said.\n    \n        \n    \n\nChrista Prince and two others were out in Brooklyn on Monday afternoon with shovels and an electric snowblower.“We’re just making a path for this car,” Prince said. “It’s not our car but you know, we’re just doing our neighbor a kind deed.”___Izaguirre reported from Albany, New York.

He does not face any allegations of sexual misconduct.His arrest comes four days after Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former Prince Andrew, was arrested on suspicion of a similar offense related to his friendship with Epstein.\n    \n        \n    \n\nMandelson was fired from his diplomatic post in September after emails were published showing that he maintained a friendship with Epstein after the financier’s 2008 conviction for sex offenses involving a minor. When more details emerged in documents released by the U.S. Justice Department last month, police opened a criminal probe.",

        "text": "A memorial grows outside the home of Nancy Guthrie, the missing mother of &quot;Today&quot; show host Savannah Guthrie, in Tucson, Ariz., Sunday, Feb. 22, 2026. (AP Photo/Felicia Fonseca)2026-02-24T00:12:07Z\n                                        TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — The disappearance of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie’s mother three weeks ago has inspired a small number of volunteers to launch their own searches in the dense desert near her home in hopes of cracking the case.The Pima County Sheriff’s Department said while it appreciates the concern for Nancy Guthrie, it asked people inquiring about volunteering to give investigators space to do their jobs. “We all want to find Nancy, but this work is best left to professionals,” the agency said in a statement over the weekend.Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen at her home just outside Tucson on Jan. 31 and was reported missing the following day. Authorities believe she was kidnapped, abducted or otherwise taken against her will. Drops of her blood were found on the front porch, but authorities haven’t publicly revealed much evidence. \n    \n        \n    \n\nDespite the sheriff’s request for people not to search on their own, volunteers have continued to look. A small group reported finding a black backpack on Sunday, but it wasn’t the same brand as one identified in video surveillance that the FBI released of a masked man at Guthrie’s home the night she disappeared. \n\nA sheriffs’ spokesperson told Tucson television station KOLD that the bag and its contents didn’t appear to be viable leads. The Associated Press reached out to the sheriff’s department for comment on Monday.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nTwo women from the group Madres Buscadoras de Sonora, or “Searching Mothers of Sonora,” who were carrying digging tools Sunday outside of Guthrie’s home, said they, too, would join the search. They posted fliers on Guthrie’s mailbox with her picture and their contact information.Tony Estrada, the former long-time sheriff in neighboring Santa Cruz County, said volunteer searchers have good intentions in wanting to help and can serve as a force multiplier, but it’s crucial that their efforts be coordinated with law enforcement.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“You can’t have people all over the place looking for something and not reporting to anybody or letting them know that they’re going to be in that area,” Estrada said. “They may be trampling into things that may come out to be helpful in the future.”Nearly all search operations for U.S. law enforcement agencies are staffed with volunteers, said Chris Boyer, executive director of the National Association for Search and Rescue.Untrained volunteers who show up to help in a search may mean well, but experts say they could end up contaminating a crime scene.“It’s painful for law enforcement when that happens,” Boyer said. Volunteers should undergo background checks, be trained in things like administering first aid and preserving crime scenes, and work under the direction of law enforcement authorities, said Boyer, whose group provides education, certification and advocacy for search and rescue efforts across the United States and other countries.Several hundred people are working the Guthrie investigation, and more than 20,000 tips have been received, the sheriff’s office has said. The FBI and other agencies are assisting. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe sheriff’s office has watched around the clock lately at Guthrie’s house. It also enacted a temporary one-way flow on the road so that emergency vehicles and trash collection trucks could get through. The constant presence of news crews, bloggers and curious onlookers has drawn mixed reaction from neighbors.Some appreciated the attention the case has been getting. Others have placed traffic cones and signs on their properties to keep people off. Meanwhile, the tribute to Nancy Guthrie outside her home keeps growing, with flowers, yellow ribbons, crosses, prayers and patron saints for older adults and in desperate situations.Aran Aleamoni and his daughter Ariana picked out a bouquet of red, pink and white flowers and placed them at the edge of Guthrie’s yard, alongside a sign that read “Let Nancy Come Home” and a statuette of an angel.“My heart goes out to the entire family,” said Aran Aleamoni, who has known the Guthrie family for a long time. “We are all pulling for you. We’re with you in your corner.”___Billeaud reported from Phoenix.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JACQUES BILLEAUD\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Billeaud is an Associated Press reporter who covers courts and law enforcement in Arizona.

        "title": "ICE officer training is ‘deficient’ and ‘broken,’ former agency lawyer tells congressional forum",
        "text": "Federal agents walk down a street while conducting immigration enforcement operations, Thursday, Feb. 5, 2026, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Ryan Murphy, File)2026-02-23T22:30:42Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — A former U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lawyer who was responsible for training new deportation officers warned Monday that the agency’s training program for new recruits is “deficient, defective and broken.”Ryan Schwank’s comments during a forum held by congressional Democrats come at a time of intense scrutiny of the officers tasked with carrying out President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda. Critics, including rights groups and Democratic politicians, have accused deportation officers of using excessive force when arresting immigrants, attacking bystanders who record their conduct and failing to follow constitutional protections of people’s rights.The Department of Homeland Security is rapidly scaling up the number of deportation officers, raising concerns that it will sacrifice proper screening and training of applicants in a rush to get them into the field. The department denied it was cutting corners, saying new officers get trained on firearms, use-of-force policies and how to safely arrest people.\n    \n        \n    \n\nSchwank testified during a hearing hosted by Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Rep. Robert Garcia of California. Blumenthal’s office said Schwank resigned from the agency on Feb. 13.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n“I am here because I am duty-bound to report the legally required training program at the ICE academy is deficient, defective and broken,” Schwank said.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nHe also accused the department of dismantling the training program for new deportation officers and lying about what they were doing.“DHS told the public the new cadets receive all the training they need to perform their duties, that no critical material or standards have been cut,” he said. “This is a lie. ICE made the program shorter, and they removed so many essential parts that what remains is a dangerous husk.”Monday’s was the third public forum held by the two Democrats to examine how ICE is training thousands of new officers and the conduct of those officers once they’re on the streets. Both have been vocal critics of how ICE officers conduct themselves. At the beginning of the hearing, Blumenthal thanked the witnesses, including Schwank, for their “courage and strength.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nBlumenthal’s office said Schwank was one of two anonymous whistleblowers who came forward earlier to disclose a new ICE policy authorizing deportation officers to forcibly enter an immigrant’s home to remove them from the country even if they didn’t have a warrant signed by a judge.His office also released dozens of pages of documents related to the training of new deportation officers, noting the disclosure came from whistleblowers.Blumenthal’s office said the documents demonstrated “drastic cuts” to how new deportation officers are trained and tested. That includes changes to the number of exams new officers have to pass, the classes they have to take and the hours they train.“The training has been truncated and reduced, both in numbers of courses and substantive policy,” the senator said at the start of the hearing. \n    \n        \n    \n\nHomeland Security strongly denied that it has removed any training requirements or lessened requirements for officers. ICE recruits receive 56 days of training and 28 days on average of on-the-job training, the department said Monday in response to an inquiry about the allegations made during the forum.“Despite false claims from the media and sanctuary politicians, no training hours have been cut. Our officers receive extensive firearm training, are taught de-escalation tactics, and receive Fourth and Fifth Amendment comprehensive instruction,” department spokeswoman Lauren Bis said in an e-mailed statement.She also said ICE recruits are monitored on the job after graduating from the academy.The department has “streamlined training to cut redundancy and incorporate technology advancements, without sacrificing basic subject matter content,” Bis said.The documents show that ICE is eliminating over a dozen “practical exams” that used to be necessary for deportation officers to pass, according to an analysis by Democratic Senate staff. ICE also appears to have cut a number of classes from the training, including “Use of Force Simulation Training.”Deportation officers appear to be getting fewer hours of training overall, according to the documents.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                REBECCA SANTANA\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Santana covers the Department of Homeland Security for The Associated Press.

        "title": "Chicagoans name snowplow ‘Abolish ICE’ in annual contest",
        "text": "A man crosses Wacker Drive in front of a waiting city snowplow in Chicago, Jan. 28, 2019. (Rich Hein/Chicago Sun-Times via AP, File)2026-02-23T23:07:34Z\n                                        When it comes to putting a name to Chicago’s annual battle against its infamously inclement weather, it turns out that the practical is also the political. “Abolish ICE” was the top vote-getter in the city’s “You Name a Snowplow” contest. Choosing the protest slogan with a double meaning proved a potent way for voters to jab at President Donald Trump after he sent Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents into the city and its suburbs last fall in a major immigration crackdown.With a surge of ICE agents beginning in September, “Operation Midway Blitz” resulted in more than 4,000 arrests, a fatal shooting and a sour taste among Chicago’s Democratic leaders and many of its residents, particularly in large immigrant populations. Despite mid-winter frigid cold, “ICE Out” protests in recent weeks have continued downtown, near ICE facilities and throughout the suburbs.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe snowplow contest, in its fourth year, also produced names ranging from those paying tribute to the new pope, who hails from Chicago, to a homegrown horror purveyor and the popular quarterback of the city’s NFL franchise. In a statement, Mayor Brandon Johnson thanked Chicago voters “for their unmatched creativity, sense of humor, and civic pride.”\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nWhen asked whether he was reticent about the potentially prickly response to the name, a spokesperson said that “Abolish ICE” was the runaway winner, adding, “The people of Chicago clearly have no issue with the name of this snowplow.”\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nRequests for comment were also emailed to ICE and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security. Contests in many cities produce names of snowplows, but they rarely carry the edge of Chicago’s top pick. In Nashville, “Dolly Plowton” pays homage to Tennessee native and country music legend Dolly Parton, while in Minnesota, pop superstar Taylor Swift is honored on a plow dubbed “Taylor Drift.” \n    \n        \n    \n\nChicagoans are capable of more anodyne names, too. Other winning contest names include “Stephen Coldbert,” for late-night talk show host Stephen Colbert. There’s “Pope Frio XIV,” with the Spanish word for “cold” rhyming with the Chicago-born pontiff’s name, Leo. Then there’s the “Blizzard of Oz” and “Svencoolie,” a play on the Chicago TV horror host, Svengoolie; and finally, Caleb Chilliams for the quarterback whose last name is Williams, and who led the Bears to the playoffs for the first time in 15 years. Johnson said he and his Department of Streets and Sanitation, which maintains 300 trucks to clear 9,400 miles (15,000 kilometers) of streets, are “grateful and inspired by the record-breaking participation in the contest this year.” There were 13,300 plow names submitted and 39,000 final votes were cast. The contest was conducted the same way as it was in the past three years, said Ryan Gage, spokesperson for the Streets and Sanitation department. Submissions are made to the Chicago Shovels website. A survey app is used for both initial and final phases of the contest. A group of Streets and Sanitation staff members then reviews all the submissions and chooses the finalists, which are then forwarded to the mayor’s office for final approval, Gage said. ___O’Connor reported from Springfield, Ill.",

        "title": "The Age-Verification Trap",
        "text": "Social media is going the way of alcohol, gambling, and other social sins: Societies are deciding it’s no longer kid stuff. Lawmakers point to compulsive use, exposure to harmful content, and mounting concerns about adolescent mental health. So, many propose to set a minimum age, usually 13 or 16.In cases when regulators demand real enforcement rather than symbolic rules, platforms run into a basic technical problem. The only way to prove that someone is old enough to use a site is to collect personal data about who they are. And the only way to prove that you checked is to keep the data indefinitely. Age-restriction laws push platforms toward intrusive verification systems that often directly conflict with modern data-privacy law.This is the age-verification trap. Strong enforcement of age rules undermines data privacy.How Does Age Enforcement Actually Work?Most age-restriction laws follow a familiar pattern. They set a minimum age and require platforms to take “reasonable steps” or “effective measures” to prevent underage access. What these laws rarely spell out is how platforms are supposed to tell who is actually over the line. At the technical level, companies have only two tools.The first is identity-based verification. Companies ask users to upload a government ID, link a digital identity, or provide documents that prove their age. Yet in many jurisdictions, 16-year-olds do not have IDs. In others, IDs exist but are not digital, not widely held, or not trustworthy. Storing copies of identity documents also creates security and misuse risks.The second option is inference. Platforms try to guess age based on behavior, device signals, or biometric analysis, most commonly facial age estimation from selfies or videos. This avoids formal ID collection, but it replaces certainty with probability and error.In practice, companies combine both. Self-declared ages are backed by inference systems. When confidence drops, or regulators ask for proof of effort, inference escalates to ID checks. What starts as a light-touch checkpoint turns into layered verification that follows users over time.What Are Platforms Doing Now?This pattern is already visible on major platforms.Meta has deployed facial age estimation on Instagram in multiple markets, using video-selfie checks through third-party partners. When the system flags users as possibly underaged, it prompts them to record a short selfie video. An AI system estimates their age and, if it decides they are under the threshold, restricts or locks the account. Appeals often trigger additional checks, and misclassifications are common.TikTok has confirmed that it also scans public videos to infer users’ ages. Google and YouTube rely heavily on behavioral signals tied to viewing history and account activity to infer age, then ask for government ID or a credit card when the system is unsure. A credit card functions as a proxy for adulthood, even though it says nothing about who is actually using the account. The Roblox games site, which recently launched a new age-estimate system, is already suffering from users selling child-aged accounts to adult predators seeking entry to age-restricted areas, Wired reports.For a typical user, age is no longer a one-time declaration. It becomes a recurring test. A new phone, a change in behavior, or a false signal can trigger another check. Passing once does not end the process.How Do Age-Verification Systems Fail?These systems fail in predictable ways.False positives are common. Platforms identify as minors adults with youthful faces, or adults who are sharing family devices, or have otherwise unusual usage. They lock accounts, sometimes for days. False negatives also persist. Teenagers learn quickly how to evade checks by borrowing IDs, cycling accounts, or using VPNs.The appeal process itself creates new privacy risks. Platforms must store biometric data, ID images, and verification logs long enough to defend their decisions to regulators. So if an adult who is tired of submitting selfies to verify their age finally uploads an ID, the system must now secure that stored ID. Each retained record becomes a potential breach target.Scale that experience across millions of users, and you bake the privacy risk into how platforms work.Is Age Verification Compatible With Privacy Law?This is where emerging age-restriction policy collides with existing privacy law.Modern data-protection regimes all rest on similar ideas: Collect only what you need, use it only for a defined purpose, and keep it only as long as necessary.Age enforcement undermines all three.To prove they are following age-verification rules, platforms must log verification attempts, retain evidence, and monitor users over time. When regulators or courts ask whether a platform took reasonable steps, “We collected less data” is rarely persuasive. For companies, defending themselves against accusations of neglecting to properly verify age supersedes defending themselves against accusations of inappropriate data collection.It is not an explicit choice by voters or policymakers, but instead a reaction to enforcement pressure and how companies perceive their litigation risk.Less Developed Countries, Deeper SurveillanceOutside wealthy democracies, the trade-off is even starker.Brazil’s Statute of Child-rearing and Adolescents (ECA in Portuguese) imposes strong child-protection duties online, while its data-protection law restricts data collection and processing. Now providers operating in Brazil must adopt effective age-verification mechanisms and can no longer rely on self-declaration alone for high-risk services. Yet they also face uneven identity infrastructure and widespread device sharing. To compensate, they rely more heavily on facial estimation and third-party verification vendors.In Nigeria many users lack formal IDs. Digital service providers fill the gap with behavioral analysis, biometric inference, and offshore verification services, often with limited oversight. Audit logs grow, data flows expand, and the practical ability of users to understand or contest how companies infer their age shrinks accordingly. Where identity systems are weak, companies do not protect privacy. They bypass it.The paradox is clear. In countries with less administrative capacity, age enforcement often produces more surveillance, not less, because inference fills the void of missing documents.How Do Enforcement Priorities Change Expectations?Some policymakers assume that vague standards preserve flexibility. In the U.K., then–Digital Secretary Michelle Donelan, argued in 2023 that requiring certain online safety outcomes without specifying the means would avoid mandating particular technologies. Experience suggests the opposite.When disputes reach regulators or courts, the question is simple: Can minors still access the platform easily? If the answer is yes, authorities tell companies to do more. Over time, “reasonable steps” become more invasive.Repeated facial scans, escalating ID checks, and long-term logging become the norm. Platforms that collect less data start to look reckless by comparison. Privacy-preserving designs lose out to defensible ones.This pattern is familiar, including online sales-tax enforcement. After courts settled that large platforms had an obligation to collect and remit sales taxes, companies began continuous tracking and storage of transaction destinations and customer location signals. That tracking is not abusive, but once enforcement requires proof over time, companies build systems to log, retain, and correlate more data. Age verification is moving the same way. What begins as a one-time check becomes an ongoing evidentiary system, with pressure to monitor, retain, and justify user-level data.The Choice We Are AvoidingNone of this is an argument against protecting children online. It is an argument against pretending there is no trade-off.Some observers present privacy-preserving age proofs involving a third party, such as the government, as a solution, but they inherit the same structural flaw: Many users who are legally old enough to use a platform do not have government ID. In countries where the minimum age for social media is lower than the age at which ID is issued, platforms face a choice between excluding lawful users and monitoring everyone. Right now, companies are making that choice quietly, after building systems and normalizing behavior that protects them from the greater legal risks. Age-restriction laws are not just about kids and screens. They are reshaping how identity, privacy, and access work on the Internet for everyone.The age-verification trap is not a glitch. It is what you get when regulators treat age enforcement as mandatory and privacy as optional.",

(AP Photo/Ben McKeown)2026-02-23T18:02:52Z\n                                        Duke’s win against Michigan has propelled the Blue Devils to a familiar perch: No. 1 in The Associated Press men’s college basketball poll.The Blue Devils climbed two spots to top Monday’s poll, marking the 148th appearance at No. 1 to add to what was already the record for any program. Duke (25-2) claimed 56 of 61 first-place votes to supplant Michigan (25-2) after Saturday’s 68-63 win against the Wolverines in Washington.That win came in a matchup of the top two teams in the NCAA men’s selection committee’s preliminary top 16 seeds for March Madness, released hours before the game. The Blue Devils enter this week with a national-best 12 Quadrant 1 wins, along with nine wins against AP Top 25 teams.And now the latest such win has pushed the Blue Devils back to a No. 1 ranking for the second straight season under fourth-year coach Jon Scheyer. Last year’s Final Four team sat atop the last two polls entering the NCAA Tournament, the first time Duke had reached No. 1 since Scheyer took over for retired Hall of Famer Mike Krzyzewski in 2022.Arizona rose two spots to No. 2 after beating BYU and winning at Houston, and secured the other five first-place votes. Michigan fell to No. 3 as its first appearance at No. 1 since January 2013 turned into a one-week stay, followed by a pair of Big 12 teams in Iowa State and Houston.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe top tierUConn fell one spot to No. 6 after a week that included a home loss to Creighton, while reigning national champion Florida leapt five spots to No. 7 to return to the top 10 for the first time since late November. The Gators were ranked No. 3 in the preseason and spent a week among the unranked in early January. They have won seven straight and 12 of 13.Purdue, Gonzaga and Illinois rounded out the top 10.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nNCAA selection committee vs. AP Top 25The selection committee had Michigan, Duke, Arizona and Iowa State as the No. 1 seeds in Saturday’s reveal of the preliminary top 16 seeds. The Cyclones edged UConn and Houston for the fourth 1-seed, with the Huskies’ loss to Creighton and then Iowa State’s head-to-head win against Houston to start last week swinging the vote to T.J. Otzelberger’s squad.Monday’s poll largely aligns with the committee’s reveal, starting with the same four teams at the top in a shuffled order — with Iowa State moving up two spots even after Saturday’s loss at now-No. 19 BYU.In addition, the AP Top 25 and committee align on 15 teams being ranked among those top 16 seeds. The outlier is St. John’s at No. 15 in the AP poll, taking a slot that went to Vanderbilt — with the Commodores seeded 15th overall by the committee Saturday but sliding to No. 25 in Monday’s poll.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nRisingAlabama had the week’s biggest jump, rising eight spots to No. 17 after a thrilling double-overtime home win against Arkansas and a win at LSU pushed the Crimson Tide’s win streak to six games.Florida had the week’s second-biggest gain, while BYU rose four spots after the Arizona loss and Iowa State win. In all, 11 teams moved up from last week’s ranking.\n    \n        \n    \n\nSlidingNo. 14 Kansas joined Vanderbilt with the week’s biggest slide of six spots. The Jayhawks are coming off a 16-point home loss to a Cincinnati team that was reeling in early February but has won four straight.The Commodores lost at Missouri and at home to Tennessee last week, falling to 5-6 since a 16-0 start that carried them to a No. 10 ranking as of mid-January. Saint Louis tumbled five spots to No. 23 after last week’s loss at Rhode Island ended an 18-game winning streak, while 11 teams fell from last week but remained in the poll.\n    \n        \n    \n\nStatus quoIllinois and No. 20 Arkansas were the only two teams to hold their position from last week.Coming and goingTennessee was the lone new addition at No. 22, with the Volunteers beating Oklahoma and Vanderbilt last week to push its winning streak to four games. This starts a third stint in the poll for Rick Barnes’ Volunteers, who fell out for two weeks in mid-January, returned for a week at No. 25 to start February, then were unranked again for the past two weeks.The Vols replaced Wisconsin, which fell out from No. 24 after last week’s loss at Ohio State.\n    \n        \n    \n\nConference watchThe Big 12 led all conferences with six ranked teams, while the Big Ten and Southeastern Conference each had five.

        "title": "AI’s Math Tricks Don’t Work for Scientific Computing",
        "text": "AI has driven an explosion of new number formats—the ways in which numbers are represented digitally. Engineers are looking at every possible way to save computation time and energy, including shortening the number of bits used to represent data. But what works for AI doesn’t necessarily work for scientific computing, be it for computational physics, biology, fluid dynamics, or engineering simulations. IEEE Spectrum spoke with Laslo Hunhold, who recently joined Barcelona-based Openchip as an AI engineer, about his efforts to develop a bespoke number format for scientific computing.LASLO HUNHOLDLaslo Hunhold is a senior AI accelerator engineer at Barcelona-based startup Openchip. He recently completed a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Cologne, in Germany.What makes number formats interesting to you?Laslo Hunhold: I don’t know another example of a field that so few are interested in but has such a high impact. If you make a number format that’s 10 percent more [energy] efficient, it can translate to all applications being 10 percent more efficient, and you can save a lot of energy.Why are there so many new number formats?Hunhold: For decades, computer users had it really easy. They could just buy new systems every few years, and they would have performance benefits for free. But this hasn’t been the case for the last 10 years. In computers, you have a certain number of bits used to represent a single number, and for years the default was 64 bits. And for AI, companies noticed that they don’t need 64 bits for each number. So they had a strong incentive to go down to 16, 8, or even 2 bits [to save energy]. The problem is, the dominating standard for representing numbers in 64 bits is not well designed for lower bit counts. So in the AI field, they came up with new formats which are more tailored toward AI.Why does AI need different number formats than scientific computing? Hunhold: Scientific computing needs high dynamic range: You need very large numbers, or very small numbers, and very high accuracy in both cases. The 64-bit standard has an excessive dynamic range, and it is many more bits than you need most of the time. It’s different with AI. The numbers usually follow a specific distribution, and you don’t need as much accuracy.What makes a number format “good”?Hunhold: You have infinite numbers but only finite bit representations. So you need to decide how you assign numbers. The most important part is to represent numbers that you’re actually going to use. Because if you represent a number that you don’t use, you’ve wasted a representation. The simplest thing to look at is the dynamic range. The next is distribution: How do you assign your bits to certain values? Do you have a uniform distribution, or something else? There are infinite possibilities.What motivated you to introduce the takum number format?Hunhold: Takums are based on posits. In posits, the numbers that get used more frequently can be represented with more density. But posits don’t work for scientific computing, and this is a huge issue. They have a high density for [numbers close to one], which is great for AI, but the density falls off sharply once you look at larger or smaller values. People have been proposing dozens of number formats in the last few years, but takums are the only number format that’s actually tailored for scientific computing. I found the dynamic range of values you use in scientific computations, if you look at all the fields, and designed takums such that when you take away bits, you don’t reduce that dynamic rangeThis article appears in the March 2026 print issue as “Laslo Hunhold.”",

The prestigious London red carpet delivered a masterclass in high-end horology, proving that Hollywood's elite are increasingly opting for niche heritage designs, rare materials, and stealth-wealth statements over standard modern pieces.Leading the vintage revival, Michael B. Jordan embraced the trend of men donning vintage ladies' watches, wearing a 1970s Vacheron Constantin Vintage Prestige de la France cast in 18-karat yellow gold and set with diamonds. Paul Mescal kept things understated with a 1999 Cartier Tank Basculante featuring a unique reversible rectangular case. The Cartier love continued with David Jonsson wearing a 1970s gold Vintage Vendome, Tom Blyth dripping in a large gold Santos-Dumont, and Robert Aramayo sporting a sleek steel Ballon Bleu.On the chronograph front, Leonardo DiCaprio secured a major flex with a white-gold Rolex Daytona “Le Mans.” Released to mark the centenary of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the piece had a notoriously short 10-month production run, making it a highly coveted modern grail. Ryan Coogler also brought the heat with a beautiful Rolex Daytona featuring a rare meteorite dial, celebrating his historic Best Original Screenplay win. Meanwhile, Aaron Pierre stepped out in the latest Omega Speedmaster Moonwatch Professional, flexing a Moonshine gold case and a striking reverse panda dial with mirrored black lacquer.Avant-garde and stealth-wealth choices were out in full force. Timothée Chalamet won the style game in a rare Urban Jürgensen UJ-2, while Stormzy paired his sharp tailoring with a black ceramic Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Double Balance Wheel Openworked. Patrick Dempsey opted for a TAG Heuer Carrera Tourbillon featuring a signature bezel-free glassbox design and a smoky purple sunray dial.Rounding out the robust list, Omega Seamasters made a strong showing. Ethan Hawke added a fun spin to his black-tie attire with a steel Aqua Terra boasting a pine green dial, while Stellan Skarsgård wore a gold Seamaster Milano Cortina 2026 edition. Finally, Miles Caton swapped his usual wristwear for a sporty 40mm steel Louis Vuitton Tambour featuring an integrated bracelet and an on-trend blue dial.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "British designer Daniel Lee closed London Fashion Week with a sweeping tribute to the city he calls home. For Fall/Winter 2026, Burberry staged its show inside a former Victorian fish market along the banks of the River Thames, drawing a crowd that included Stormzy and Barry Keoghan.In a theatrical nod to the capital’s famously unpredictable weather, guests stepped carefully over puddles en route to their seats — an immersive detail that set the tone for a collection rooted in London’s rhythms. Celebrating 170 years of Burberry, Lee sent the house’s iconic Check on a nocturnal journey from Hackney to Mayfair, mapping the city’s layered identities after dark. “We all walk the same roads. We’re all lit by the same streetlamps. We all feel the same buzz of the city at night,” Lee noted in the show notes. A ruffled reinterpretation of Burberry’s signature trench coat opened the runway in pale grey, soon followed by midnight-blue versions distorted in scale — some exaggerated, others sharply cropped. Leather boiler suits, quilted moto jackets, and olive-green tuxedos dissolved into the dimly lit set, while plush fur-trimmed coats and rich burgundy bombers brought depth and drama presented by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Romeo Beckham. Sleek yet subversive, refined yet rebellious, Burberry FW26 captured London in all its contrasts. Lee observes the capital through rain-slicked streets, hushed conversations, and electric possibility shimmering beneath the stars.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

They deserve this rematch, which will be even bigger since it will be streamed live globally on Netflix. I want Floyd to be forever haunted by the one loss on his professional record and always remember who gave it to him. As always, I dedicate this fight to my fellow Filipinos around the world, and to bring glory to the Philippines.”Mayweather, coming out of retirement for the bout, remains confident, asserting that the result will mirror their first encounter. “I already fought and beat Manny once,” he said. “This time will be the same result.”Netflix’s entry into live combat sports continues to expand with this marquee event. “Earlier in my career, I spent weeks in Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao’s training camps in Las Vegas and the Philippines,” shared Gabe Spitzer, Vice President of Sports at Netflix. “It was undeniable that they were the two hardest workers in boxing, and their wins and accolades were a product of that. Bringing this rematch to Netflix is a massive ‘full circle’ moment. We’re thrilled to combine their storied rivalry with the immersive technology of Sphere to deliver a landmark sporting event to our members worldwide.”While ticket details are still forthcoming, the fight will be available to all Netflix subscribers without a separate pay-per-view fee, potentially setting a new standard for accessibility in major boxing events.The Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao rematch streams live September 19, exclusively on Netflix.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

These pieces will be displayed within the museum's newly named Condé Nast Galleries, emphasizing the symbiotic relationship between the garment and the artistic canon.“What connects every curatorial department and what connects every single gallery in the museum is fashion, or the dressed body,” Andrew Bolton, the Costume Institute's curator, shared. “It’s the common thread throughout the whole museum, which is really what the initial idea for the exhibition was.”To helm the event, Vogue’s Anna Wintour has assembled a diverse group of cultural icons. Music royalty Beyoncé returns to the steps as a co-chair, joined by Academy Award winner Nicole Kidman and tennis legend Venus Williams. They will be supported by a host committee that bridges the worlds of luxury and entertainment, co-chaired by creative director Anthony Vaccarello and actress Zoë Kravitz, and includes Sabrina Carpenter, Doja Cat, Gwendoline Christie, Alex Consani, Misty Copeland, Elizabeth Debicki, Lena Dunham, Paloma Elsesser, LISA, Chloe Malle, Sam Smith, Teyana Taylor, Lauren Wasser, Anna Weyant, A’ja Wilson, Yseult, Adut Akech, Angela Bassett, Sinéad Burke, Rebecca Hall, Aimee Mullins, Tschabalala Self, Amy Sherald, and Chase Sui Wonders. Meanwhile, lead sponsors Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos will serve as honorary chairs.The 2026 Met Gala will take place on May 4 at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "SummaryTomokazu Matsuyama debuts “Morning Again” at Times Square Arts’ Midnight Moment, running nightly from April 1 – 30, 2026Over 90 LED screens synchronize for three minutes, replacing ads with abstract imagery of hope, rhythm, self‑expression, and transformationFor one month starting April 1, 2026, Brooklyn-based artist Tomokazu Matsuyama will take over New York’s Times Square with his latest digital public art project, \"Morning Again.\" As part of the prestigious Midnight Moment program, the city’s largest and longest-running digital art series, Matsuyama’s work will synchronize across more than 96 massive LED screens from 41st to 49th Streets. Every night for three minutes - from 11:57 p.m. to midnight - the usual commercial advertisements will vanish, replaced by a 180-second cinematic experience that merges the city’s pulse with Matsuyama’s vibrant, cross-cultural aesthetic.Born in Gifu, Japan and seasoned by decades in the cultural melting pot of New York, Tomokazu Matsuyama is widely recognized for his ability to bridge disparate worlds. His practice often blends Edo-period iconography and traditional Japanese craft with Western Pop art, street culture, and Abstract Expressionism.“Morning Again” emphasizes four key elements - hope, rhythm, self‑expression and transformation - rather than depicting specific figures. These abstract motifs unfold as shifting shapes, glowing light and vibrant hues that mirror the city’s pulse. The work highlights how diverse cultural energies intersect and overlap, creating a shared urban identity. In a time marked by uncertainty and division, Matsuyama’s installation quietly affirms diversity and individuality while suggesting the possibility of moving forward together.In keeping with Matsuyama’s signature style, the piece intentionally avoids a fixed hierarchy of imagery, allowing histories and diverse identities to coexist within the same frame. This approach reflects his ongoing exploration of \"borderless identity\" and how narratives overlap in an increasingly interconnected global society.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

B cells serve a useful but not absolutely vital role in the immune system; one can survive without B cells if necessary, at the cost of diminished immune responsiveness. Unfortunately, aging brings a growing population of dysfunctional, harmful age-associated B cells that aggravate loss of immune function and age-related disease more generally. Destruction of B cells is readily achieved in animal models, either temporarily or permanently. Temporary clearance of B cells in mice is beneficial, removing the age-associated B cells and replacing them with more functional B cells, while here researchers show that permanent life-long [&#8230;]",

Through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of lymph node changes upon vaccination in young versus aged mice, here we identify defects in DC migration during aging, alongside a dysfunction-associated gene signature in migratory DCs, and implicate these defects in the diminished vaccine response observed in aging. Furthermore, we demonstrate that oral delivery of yeast-derived nanoparticles elevates expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7 in gut dendritic cells, facilitates their trafficking to lymph nodes in response to chemotactic signals after immunization, and thus enhances vaccine-induced immunity in aged animals. These findings reveal a key mechanism of immune decline in aging and offer a noninvasive strategy to improve dendritic cell function and vaccine efficacy in aging.\n                \n                Longevity Relevance Analysis\n                The paper claims that enhancing dendritic cell migration through gut-immune crosstalk can improve vaccine efficacy in aged mice.
