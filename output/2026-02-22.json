        "title": "Ghislaine Maxwell fights release of more Epstein documents, calling disclosure law unconstitutional",
        "text": "A document that was included in the U.S. Department of Justice release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, photographed Tuesday, Feb. 10, 2026, shows a photo of Ghislaine Maxwell in 2019. (AP Photo/Jon Elswick)2026-02-21T19:39:54Z\n                                        NEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers for imprisoned British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell are fighting the requested release of 90,000 pages related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell, saying a law used to force the public release of millions of documents is unconstitutional.The lawyers filed papers late Friday in Manhattan federal court to try to block the release of documents from a since-settled civil defamation lawsuit brought a decade ago by the late Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre against Maxwell. The Justice Department recently asked a judge to lift secrecy requirements on the files.Maxwell’s attorneys said the Justice Department obtained the documents — otherwise subject to secrecy orders — improperly during its criminal probe of Maxwell. They said the documents include transcripts of over 30 depositions and private information regarding financial and sexual matters related to Maxwell and others.\n    \n        \n    \n\nSome records from the year-long exchange of evidence in the lawsuit battle were already released publicly in response to a federal appeals court order.Maxwell’s lawyers say a law Congress passed in December to force the release of millions of Epstein-related documents violates the Constitution’s separation of powers doctrine. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n“Congress cannot, by statute, strip this Court of the power or relieve it of the responsibility to protect its files from misuse. To do so violates the separation of powers,” wrote the lawyers, Laura Menninger and Jeffrey Pagliuca about the Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“Under the Constitution’s separation of powers, neither Congress nor the Executive Branch may intrude on the judicial power. That power includes the power to definitively and finally resolve cases and disputes,” the lawyers added.The release of Epstein-related documents from criminal probes that began weeks ago has resulted in new revelations about Epstein’s decades-long sexual abuse of women and teenage girls. Some victims have complained that their names and personal information were revealed in documents while the names of their abusers were blacked out.\n    \n        \n    \n\nMembers of Congress have complained that only about half of existing documents, many with redactions, have been made public even as Justice Department officials have said everything has been released, except for some files that can’t be made public until a judge gives the go-ahead.Giuffre said Epstein had trafficked her to other men, including the former Prince Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. She sued Mountbatten-Windsor in 2021, claiming that they had sex when she was 17. He denied her claims and the two settled the lawsuit in 2022. Days ago, he was arrested and held in custody for nearly 11 hours on suspicion of misconduct in having shared confidential trade information with Epstein.In a memoir published after she killed herself last year, Giuffre wrote that prosecutors told her they didn’t include her in the sex trafficking prosecution of Maxwell because they didn’t want her allegations to distract the jury.\n    \n        \n    \n\nMaxwell, 64, was convicted in December 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Maxwell was moved from a federal prison in Florida to a low-security prison camp in Texas last summer after she participated in two days of interviews with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.Two weeks ago, she declined to answer questions from House Oversight Committee lawmakers in a deposition conducted in a a video call to her federal prison camp, though she indicated through a statement from her lawyer that she was “prepared to speak fully and honestly” if granted clemency.The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                MICHAEL R.

        "title": "ICE begins to purchase warehouses, but some owners are backing out of deals",
        "text": "A warehouse purchased by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Surprise, Ariz., is seen Saturday, Feb. 14, 2026. (AP Photo/Ty ONeil)2026-02-21T13:07:08Z\n                                        More than 20 town with large warehouses have become stealth targets for Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s $45 billion expansion of detention centers. Some communities complain that ICE isn’t telling them anything until after it has purchased space for thousands of detainees. In some cases, warehouses owners are refusing to sell. A look at some of the locations:ArizonaLocal officials were told nothing before ICE purchased a 418,000-square-foot (38,833-square-meter) warehouse in the Phoenix suburb of Surprise for $70 million, the state’s top prosecutor, Kris Mayes, said in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.Documents later provided by ICE said the Department of Homeland Security estimates it will spend $150 million retrofitting the facility into a 1,500-bed processing site.FloridaA TV reporter in Orlando spotted private contractors and federal officials last month touring a 439,945-square-foot (40,872-square-meter) industrial warehouse. ICE senior adviser David Venturella told a WFTV reporter the tour was “exploratory.” Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said in a statement that the city hasn’t been contacted by the federal government and that it has no legal options to stop a possible ICE facility. \n    \n        \n    \n\nGeorgia ICE bought a massive warehouse in Social Circle for $128.6 million. Documents provided to the city by DHS show it has plans for two other buildings as well. Combined, they would total 2.3 million square feet (213,677 square meters). Plans also are in the works to convert a warehouse in Oakwood into an ICE processing facility, Republican U.S. Rep. Andrew Clyde said in a statement, although no deed has been filed. City Manager B.R. White said his first inkling that a deal was imminent came when a warehouse supervisor told a city inspector he’d been instructed to clear the job site to make way for the new owners — the federal government. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nIndianaAfter the town of Merrillville raised concerns about ICE touring a new 275,000-square-foot (25,548-square-meter) warehouse, owner Opus Holding LLC sent a letter stating it isn’t negotiating with federal officials for the property. The letter said Opus was limited in what it could share because of legal issues. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nMarylandICE purchased a warehouse about 60 miles (96 kilometers) northwest of Baltimore for $102.4 million, a deed signed last month shows. The deed was unearthed by Project Salt Box, a Maryland ICE watchdog. Officials in Washington County said in a Facebook post that DHS notified them beforehand that it was considering purchasing the warehouse for use as a “new ICE Baltimore Processing Facility.” County commissioners later passed a resolution in support of ICE activities.\n    \n        \n    \n\nMichiganICE announced its purchase of a facility in Romulus after the deal was completed. The city responded in a Facebook post that officials were concerned about the “lack of prior notification.”MinnesotaThe owners of warehouses in the Minneapolis suburbs of Woodbury and Shakopee pulled out of possible ICE deals after public outcry, according to local officials.MississippiRepublican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker posted that Noem agreed to look elsewhere after local elected and zoning officials opposed a possible detention center in the town of Byhalia. \n    \n        \n    \n\nMissouriAfter weeks of public pressure, development company Platform Ventures announced it would not move forward with the sale of a massive warehouse in Kansas City. New HampshireRepublican Gov. Kelly Ayotte sparred with federal officials after ICE disclosed plans to spend $158 million to convert a warehouse in Merrimack into a 500-bed processing center.The issue came to a head when interim ICE Director Todd Lyons testified that DHS “has worked with Gov. Ayotte” and provided her with an economic impact summary. Ayotte said the assertion was “simply not true.” She said the summary was sent hours after Lyons testified. The document erroneously refers to the “ripple effects to the Oklahoma economy” and revenue generated by state sales and income taxes, neither of which exist in New Hampshire. \n    \n        \n    \n\nNew Jersey Roxbury said Friday that ICE had closed on the sale of a warehouse despite it offering tax abatements to the owner to stop the purchase. No property documents were yet available online showing the price of the sale. The announcement came just two days after ICE said it had made a “mistake” when it previously announced the purchase. “Let us be clear: Roxbury Township will not passively accept this outcome,” the mayor and city council wrote in a news release.New YorkICE said Tuesday it made a mistake when it announced the purchase of a vacant warehouse in Chester. New York state Assemblyman Brian Maher said Friday that ICE is no longer considering the facility. OklahomaOklahoma City Mayor David Holt announced last month that property owners had informed him they are no longer engaged with DHS about a potential acquisition or lease of a warehouse.PennsylvaniaDHS purchased a warehouse in Tremont Township for $119.5 million and one in Upper Bern Township for $87.4 million. Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro has said his administration will fight DHS’ plans to convert the warehouses in rural parts of eastern Pennsylvania into immigrant detention and processing centers. \n    \n        \n    \n\nTexasIn the El Paso suburb of Socorro, ICE paid $122.8 million for a trio of warehouses that span 826,780 square feet (76,810 square meters). ICE also paid $66.1 million for a 639,595-square-foot (59,420-square-meter) warehouse in San Antonio. The mayors of both cities are opposed.However, another deal in the state was scuttled following community backlash. In the Dallas suburb of Hutchins, a real estate company confirmed that it was contacted about one of its properties but wouldn’t sell or lease any buildings to DHS for use as a detention facility. California-based Majestic Realty Co. provided no explanation in its statement. UtahSalt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall expressed gratitude in her State of the City address that the owners of a warehouse that ICE was eying as a detention facility had announced plans not to sell or lease the property to the federal government. VirginiaJim Pattison Developments said in a statement last month that it became aware of the intended use of a warehouse in the suburbs of Richmond, Virginia, after agreeing to sell to a U.S. government contractor. Following boycott threats, the Vancouver-based company announced that the transaction “will not be proceeding.”___Associated Press reporters Holly Ramer, Isabella Volmert and Marc Levy contributed to this report. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                HEATHER HOLLINGSWORTH\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Hollingsworth has worked for The AP for 25 years, covering stories of interest in the Midwest and beyond.

        "text": "A newly built warehouse is seen on Friday, Feb. 6, 2026, in Social Circle, Ga., where officials are concerned about U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement&#x27;s plans connected to a $45-billion expansion of immigrant detention centers. (AP Photo/Mike Stewart)2026-02-21T13:06:38Z\n                                        SOCORRO, Texas (AP) — In a Texas town at the edge of the Rio Grande and a tall metal border wall, rumors swirled that federal immigration officials wanted to purchase three hulking warehouses to transform into a detention center.As local officials scrambled to find out what was happening, a deed was filed showing the Department of Homeland Security had already inked a $122.8 million deal for the 826,000-square-foot (76,738-square-meter) warehouses in Socorro, a bedroom community of 40,000 people outside El Paso.“Nobody from the federal government bothered to pick up the phone or even send us any type of correspondence letting us know what’s about to take place,” said Rudy Cruz Jr., the mayor of the predominantly Hispanic town of low-slung ranch homes and trailer parks, where orchards and irrigation ditches share the landscape with strip malls, truck stops, recycling plants and distribution warehouses.\n    \n        \n    \n\nSocorro is among at least 20 communities with large warehouses across the U.S. that have become stealth targets for Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s $45-billion expansion of detention centers. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nAs public support for the agency and President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown sags, communities are objecting to mass detentions and raising concerns that the facilities could strain water supplies and other services while reducing local tax revenue. In many cases, mayors, county commissioners, governors and members of Congress learned about ICE’s ambitions only after the agency bought or leased space for detainees, leading to shock and frustration even in areas that have backed Trump. “I just feel,” said Cruz, whose wife was born in Mexico, “that they do these things in silence so that they don’t get opposition.” \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nCommunities scramble for informationICE, which is part of DHS, has purchased at least seven warehouses in Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Texas, signed deeds show. Other deals have been announced but not yet finalized, though buyers scuttled sales in eight locations. DHS objected to calling the sites warehouses, stressing in a statement that they would be “very well structured detention facilities meeting our regular detention standards.” The process has been chaotic at times. ICE this past week acknowledged it made a “mistake” when it announced warehouse purchases in Chester, New York, and Roxbury, New Jersey. Roxbury then announced Friday that the sale there had closed. \n    \n        \n    \n\nDHS has confirmed it is looking for more detention space but hasn’t disclosed individual sites ahead of acquisitions. Some cities learned that ICE was scouting warehouses through reporters. Others were tipped off by a spreadsheet circulating online among activists whose source is unclear.It wasn’t until Feb. 13 that the scope of the warehouse project was confirmed, when the governor’s office in New Hampshire, where there is backlash to a planned 500-bed processing center, released a document from ICE showing the agency plans to spend $38.3 billion to boost detention capacity to 92,000 beds. Since Trump took office, the number of people detained by ICE has increased to 75,000 from 40,000, spread across more than 225 sites. \n    \n        \n    \n\nICE could use the warehouses to consolidate and to increase capacity. The document describes a project that includes eight large-scale detention centers, capable of housing 7,000 to 10,000 detainees each, and 16 smaller regional processing centers. The document also refers to the acquisition of 10 existing “turnkey” facilities.The project is funded through the big tax and spending cuts bill passed by Congress last year that nearly doubled DHS’ budget. To build the detention centers, the Trump administration is using military contracts. Those contracts allow a lot of secrecy and for DHS to move quickly without following the usual processes and safeguards, said Charles Tiefer, a professor emeritus of law at the University of Baltimore Law School.\n    \n        \n    \n\nSocorro facility could be among the largestIn Socorro, the ICE-owned warehouses are so large that 4 1/2 Walmart Supercenters could fit inside, standing in contrast to the remnants of the austere Spanish colonial and mission architecture that defines the town.At a recent City Council meeting, public comments stretched for hours. “I think a lot of innocent people are getting caught up in their dragnet,” said Jorge Mendoza, an El Paso County retiree whose grandparents immigrated from Mexico. Many speakers invoked concerns about three recent deaths at an ICE detention facility at the nearby Fort Bliss Army base.\n    \n        \n    \n\nCommunities fear a financial hitEven communities that backed Trump in 2024 have been caught off guard by ICE’s plans and have raised concerns.In rural Pennsylvania’s Berks County, commissioner Christian Leinbach called the district attorney, the sheriff, the jail warden and the county’s head of emergency services when he first heard ICE might buy a warehouse in Upper Bern Township, 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from his home. No one knew anything. A few days later, a local official in charge of land records informed him that ICE had bought the building — promoted by developers as a “state-of-the art logistics center” — for $87.4 million. “There was absolutely no warning,” Leinbach said during a meeting in which he raised concerns that turning the warehouse into a federal facility means a loss of more than $800,000 in local tax dollars. ICE has touted the income taxes its workers would pay, though the facilities themselves will be exempt from property taxes.A Georgia detention center could house twice the population of the city where it’s locatedIn Social Circle, Georgia, which also strongly supported Trump in 2024, officials were stunned by ICE’s plans for a facility that could hold 7,500 to 10,000 people after first learning about it through a reporter. The city, which has a population of just 5,000 and worries about the infrastructure needs for such a detention center, only heard from DHS after the $128.6 million sale of a 1 million-square-foot (92,900-square-meter) warehouse was completed. Like Socorro and Berks County, Social Circle questioned whether the water and sewage system could keep up. ICE has said it did due diligence to ensure the sites don’t overwhelm city utilities. But Social Circle said the agency’s analysis relied on a yet-to-be built sewer treatment plant. “To be clear, the City has repeatedly communicated that it does not have the capacity or resources to accommodate this demand, and no proposal presented to date has demonstrated otherwise,” the city said in a statement. And in the Phoenix suburb of Surprise, officials sent a scathing letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem after ICE without warning bought a massive warehouse in a residential area about a mile from a high school. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, raised the prospect of going to court to have the site declared a public nuisance. Crowds wait to speak in SocorroBack in Socorro, people waiting to speak against the ICE facility spilled out of the City Council chambers, some standing beside murals paying tribute to the World War II-era Braceros Program that allowed Mexican farmworkers to be guest workers in the U.S. The program stoked Socorro’s economy and population before President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s administration in the 1950s began mass deportations aimed at people who had crossed the border illegally.Eduardo Castillo, formerly an attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice, told city officials it is intimidating but “not impossible” to challenge the federal government. “If you don’t at least try,” he said, “you will end up with another inhumane detention facility built in your jurisdiction and under your watch.”___Hollingsworth reported from Kansas City, Missouri.

        "text": "With construction overwhelmingly male, Refuge says tradeswomen help survivors of abuse feel saferOne of the main challenges in maintaining the 64 homes for domestic abuse survivors run by Refuge is the reliance on a male-dominated workforce of electricians, plumbers and decorators.“The presence of men can be distressing and could trigger past traumas for our survivors,” said Lisa Cantwell-Hope, the head of property services at the charity. “Male contractors need an escort to make our survivors feel more comfortable, and we always put a notice out to all our residents saying there will be a male presence in the building today. So it can be challenging and takes up more time.” Continue reading...",

        "text": "Nigel Farage’s man in Gorton and Denton has a huge public platform, and a taste for culture war. What happens when he concerns himself with bin collections?On a bracingly cold February night in Levenshulme, a black Volkswagen people-carrier draws up outside a little parish church, around which a small crowd has begun to gather. From behind the car’s darkened windows steps the Reform candidate for the Gorton and Denton byelection, dressed in the trademark gilet that makes him look less like a politician and more like a man who has come straight from a grouse shoot. As he enters the church where the electoral hustings will take place, a leaflet is thrust into his hand, which as he will later discover with a horrified grimace, is a flyer for the local branch of the Communist League, bearing policies such as “amnesty for all immigrants” and “defend Cuba’s socialist revolution”.But then, when you are trying to attract the attention of someone as elusive as Prof Matt Goodwin, you have to seize your opportunities whenever they arise. Over recent weeks the former academic and rightwing firebrand has been a curiously intangible presence in the constituency whose representation he is seeking: perpetually detectable but not remotely approachable, always visible without ever really being seen.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)2026-02-21T15:05:43Z\n                                        NEW YORK (AP) — Blizzard warnings were issued Saturday for New York City, New Jersey and coastal communities along the East Coast as a late-winter storm set to arrive on Sunday threatened to make a mess of the start of a new week.The National Weather Service increased its assessment of the potential severity of a storm that was projected to be less ferocious only days earlier. The weather service said 1 to 2 feet (about 30 to 61 centimeters) of snow was possible in many areas as it issued blizzard warnings for New York City, Long Island, southern Connecticut and coastal communities in New Jersey and Delaware. Flooding was also possible in parts of New York and New Jersey, the weather service said.“While we do get plenty of these nor’easters that produce heavy snow and strong impacts, it’s been several years since we saw one of this magnitude across this large of a region in this very populated part of the country,” said Cody Snell, a meteorologist at the service’s Weather Prediction Center.\n    \n        \n    \n\nSnell said the storm will arrive Sunday morning in areas around Washington, D.C. before stretching toward Philadelphia and New York City and reaching Boston late Monday evening.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe weather service said the storm could begin as rainfall in some places before worsening, with the heaviest snowfall expected Sunday night and as much as 2 inches (5 centimeters) of snow an hour at times in some areas before tampering off by Monday afternoon.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe weather service warned that the storm, with steady winds of 25 to 35 mph (40 to 56 kph) would “make travel dangerous, if not impossible. Scattered downed tree limbs and power outages possible due to snow load and strong winds.”The storm approached just as the icy remains of a snowstorm that struck the region weeks earlier were finally melting away.On Saturday, officials in Atlantic City, New Jersey, urged residents and casino visitors to stay off streets during the storm, especially in low-lying neighborhoods prone to flooding.“I could go on and on probably with a good two dozen streets where we know we will get water and there will be snow on top of that, said Scott Evans, the city’s fire chief and emergency management coordinator. “So you won’t be able to see it until it’s too late, so therefore please stay at home.”",

He collaborated with a wide range of artists, including the Fania All Stars, David Byrne and Celia Cruz.His celebrated collaboration with Rubén Blades, “Siembra,” became one of the bestselling salsa albums of all time, and the pair were known for addressing social issues through the genre.Colón’s family and manager confirmed his death through social media posts.“Willie didn’t just change salsa; he expanded it, politicized it, clothed it in urban chronicles, and took it to stages where it hadn’t been heard before,” manager Pietro Carlos wrote. “His trombone was the voice of the people, an echo of the Caribbean in New York, a bridge between two cultures.” \n    \n        \n    \n\nColón, who was nominated for 10 Grammys and one Latin Grammy, made famous songs such as “El gran varón,” “Sin poderte hablar,” “Casanova,” “Amor verdad” and “Oh, qué será.”Blades said on the social platform X that he confirmed “what I was reluctant to believe” and offered his condolences to Colón’s family. \n\nThe path to the trombone — and fameBorn in New York’s Bronx borough, Colón was raised by his grandmother and aunt, who from a young age nurtured him with traditional Puerto Rican music and the typical rhythms of the Latin American repertoire, including Cuban son and tango. At age 11 he ventured into the world of music, first with flute, then bugle, trumpet and finally trombone, with which he stood out in the then-nascent genre of salsa.His interest in trombone arose after hearing Barry Rogers playing it on “Dolores,” Mon Rivera’s song with Joe Cotto.“It sounded like an elephant, a lion ... an animal. Something so different that, as soon as I heard it, I said to myself: ‘I want to play that instrument,’” he recalled in an interview published in the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo in 2011.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nAt 17 he joined the group of artists that formed the famous record label Fania Records, led and created by Jerry Masucci and Johnny Pacheco. Fania was largely responsible for the new sound that was produced in the Latin world of New York and would later be called “salsa.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nColón’s main characteristic as a musician was the fusion of rhythms, as he harmonized jazz, rock, funk, soul and R&amp;B with the old Latin school of Cuban son, cha-cha-cha, mambo and guaracha, adding the nostalgia of the traditional Puerto Rican sound that encompasses jíbara, bomba and plena music. In 2004 the Latin Recording Academy awarded Colón a special Grammy for his career and contributions to music.\n    \n        \n    \n\nCommunity leader and activistAs a community leader, Colón fought for civil rights, mostly in the United States. He was part of the Hispanic Arts Association, the Latino Commission on AIDS, the Arthur Schomburg Coalition for a Better New York and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, among others.In 1991 he was honored with the Chubb fellowship from Yale University, a public service recognition also awarded to the likes of John F. Kennedy, Moshe Dayan, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Ronald Reagan, among others.In the political arena, he served as special assistant to David Dinkins, New York’s first Black mayor, and was later appointed special assistant and adviser to Mayor Michael Bloomberg.Colón had little luck running for public office himself, however. He failed in a challenge to then-U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel in the 1994 Democratic primary, and in 2001 came in third in the Democratic primary for New York’s public advocate. He backed Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2008, but he told the Observer that he voted for Donald Trump in 2016.Colón had public clashes with artists and politicians. His friendship with Blades ruptured after Colón sued for breach of contract over the 2003 concert “Siembra ... 25 years later,” held in Puerto Rico. He also sparked a controversy when he called the then-president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, “rotten” on a social network.\n    \n        \n    \n\nColón acted in films such as “Vigilante,” “The Last Fight” and “It Could Happen to You,” and on TV in “Miami Vice” and “Demasiado Corazón.” More recently he appeared in Bad Bunny’s music video for “NuevaYol.”He is survived by his wife and four sons.___Former Associated Press writer Sigal Ratner-Arias contributed biographical material for this obituary.

        "text": "SummarySony Pictures Animation is officially developing an animated feature film centered around the Marvel anti-hero VenomFilmmaking duo Zach Lipovsky and Adam B. Stein have been tapped to direct and produce the upcoming projectFranchise star Tom Hardy is expected to be involved in the new film in an undisclosed capacitySony Pictures Animation is officially expanding its Marvel cinematic footprint with the development of an animated Venom movie. Following the immense global box-office success of the live-action trilogy, the studio is steering the popular symbiote franchise into the animated realm. The strategic shift aims to inject fresh narrative possibilities into the established character lore, building upon the massive critical and commercial triumphs of the studio's Oscar-winning Spider-Verse film series.To spearhead the new creative direction, Sony has enlisted filmmakers Zach Lipovsky and Adam B. Stein, the directing duo behind the recent horror hit Final Destination: Bloodlines. While the project is currently in its earliest stages of development, the studio is reportedly opening a writers' room to begin crafting the script. Veteran franchise producers Amy Pascal, Avi Arad, and Matt Tolmach are also likely to return to help oversee the transition from live-action to animation.A major point of interest surrounds the involvement of Tom Hardy, who famously brought Eddie Brock and the titular alien symbiote to life across three blockbuster films. Studio sources indicate that Hardy will remain connected to the animated feature, though his exact role—whether returning to provide voiceover work or stepping into a producer capacity—has yet to be confirmed. Given the extensive timeline required for feature animation and the lack of an attached writer, the film remains several years away from reaching theaters.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "SummaryThree-time Olympic gold medalist Shaun White's former Hollywood Hills home has officially hit the market for $5 million USDCurrent owner and retired Louis Vuitton executive Michael Silvaggi tapped Studio Veren for a comprehensive top-to-bottom renovationThe updated 1955 ranch-style property now features a distinctly dark and moody interior aestheticShaun White's former midcentury modern home in the Hollywood Hills has officially hit the real estate market, listing for an asking price of $5 million USD. Originally built in 1955, the classic ranch-style property is situated in the highly desirable Outpost Estates neighborhood. While the three-time Olympic snowboarder owned the residence from 2018 to 2024, the estate has since undergone a massive architectural transformation under the direction of its current owner, retired Louis Vuitton executive Michael Silvaggi.Following his $3.925 million USD purchase in 2024, Silvaggi enlisted design-build firm Studio Veren to execute a comprehensive overhaul of the 2,000-square-foot home. The collaborative vision was to elevate the space into a refined sanctuary, with Silvaggi describing the new aesthetic as a deliberate intersection of \"Tom Ford meets midcentury.\"The sweeping renovations introduced crucial structural upgrades alongside highly elevated interior finishes. Studio Veren installed a brand-new roof, upgraded windows, modern appliances, new flooring, and custom cabinetry, while simultaneously refinishing the home's exterior with full brick. Inside, the three-bedroom, two-bathroom layout intentionally abandons traditional bright California minimalism in favor of a dark, sexy palette. The redesigned living spaces emphasize rich textures and warm tones, utilizing premium materials like walnut, slate, and leather alongside tactile wall coverings to complete the luxurious atmosphere.The Hollywood Hills property is currently listed on the market for $5 million USD.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "title": "AI Data Centers Turn to High-Temperature Superconductors",
        "text": "Data centers for AI are turning the world of power generation on its head. There isn’t enough power capacity on the grid to even come close to how much energy is needed for the number being built. And traditional transmission and distribution networks aren’t efficient enough to take full advantage of all the power available. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), annual transmission and distribution losses average about 5 percent. The rate is much higher in some other parts of the world. Hence, hyperscalers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure are investigating every avenue to gain more power and raise efficiency.Microsoft, for example, is extolling the potential virtues of high-temperature superconductors (HTS) as a replacement for copper wiring. According to the company, HTS can improve energy efficiency by reducing transmission losses, increasing the resiliency of electrical grids, and limiting the impact of data centers on communities by reducing the amount of space required to move power.“Because superconductors take up less space to move large amounts of power, they could help us build cleaner, more compact systems,” Alastair Speirs, the general manager of global infrastructure at Microsoft wrote in a blog post.Superconductors Revolutionize Power EfficiencyCopper is a good conductor, but current encounters resistance as it moves along the line. This generates heat, lowers efficiency, and restricts how much current can be moved. HTS largely eliminates this resistance factor, as it’s made of superconducting materials that are cooled to cryogenic temperatures. (Despite the name, high-temperature superconductors still rely on frigid temperatures—albeit significantly warmer than those required by traditional superconductors.)The resulting cables are smaller and lighter than copper wiring, don’t lower voltage as they transmit current, and don’t produce heat. This fits nicely into the needs of AI data centers that are trying to cram massive electrical loads into a tiny footprint. Fewer substations would also be needed. According to Speirs, next-gen superconducting transmission lines deliver capacity that is an order of magnitude higher than conventional lines at the same voltage level.Microsoft is working with partners on the advancement of this technology including an investment of US $75 million into Veir, a superconducting power technology developer. Veir’s conductors use HTS tape, most commonly based on a class of materials known as rare-earth barium copper oxide (REBCO). REBCO is a ceramic superconducting layer deposited as a thin film on a metal substrate, then engineered into a rugged conductor that can be assembled into power cables.“The key distinction from copper or aluminum is that, at operating temperature, the superconducting layer carries current with almost no electrical resistance, enabling very high current density in a much more compact form factor,” says Tim Heidel, Veir’s CEO and co-founder.Liquid Nitrogen Cooling in Data Centers  Ruslan Nagimov, the principal infrastructure engineer for Cloud Operations and Innovation at Microsoft, stands near the world’s first HTS-powered rack prototype.MicrosoftHTS cables still operate at cryogenic temperatures, so cooling must be integrated into the power delivery system design. Veir maintains a low operating temperature using a closed-loop liquid nitrogen system: The nitrogen circulates through the length of the cable, exits at the far end, is re-cooled, and then recirculated back to the start.“Liquid nitrogen is a plentiful, low cost, safe material used in numerous critical commercial and industrial applications at enormous scale,” says Heidel. “We are leveraging the experience and standards for working with liquid nitrogen proven in other industries to design stable, data center solutions designed for continuous operation, with monitoring and controls that fit critical infrastructure expectations rather than lab conditions.”HTS cable cooling can either be done within the data center or externally. Heidel favors the latter as that minimizes footprint and operational complexity indoors. Liquid nitrogen lines are fed into the facility to serve the superconductors. They deliver power to where it’s needed and the cooling system is managed like other facility subsystem.Rare earth materials, cooling loops, cryogenic temperatures—all of this adds considerably to costs. Thus, HTS isn’t going to replace copper in the vast majority of applications. Heidel says the economics are most compelling where power delivery is constrained by space, weight, voltage drop, and heat.“In those cases, the value shows up at the system level: smaller footprints, reduced resistive losses, and more flexibility in how you route power,” says Heidel. “As the technology scales, costs should improve through higher-volume HTS tape manufacturing and better yields, and also through standardization of the surrounding system hardware, installation practices, and operating playbooks that reduce design complexity and deployment risk.”AI data centers are becoming the perfect proving ground for this approach. Hyperscalers are willing to spend to develop higher-efficiency systems. They can balance spending on development against the revenue they might make by delivering AI services broadly.“HTS manufacturing has matured—particularly on the tape side—which improves cost and supply availability,” says Husam Alissa, Microsoft’s director of systems technology. “Our focus currently is on validating and derisking this technology with our partners with focus on systems design and integration.”",

(AP) — Crews recovered the bodies of nine backcountry skiers who were killed in a California avalanche four days ago, authorities said Saturday, concluding a harrowing operation hindered by intense snowfall.A search team reached the bodies of eight victims and found one other who had been missing and presumed dead since Tuesday’s avalanche on Castle Peak near Lake Tahoe. The ninth person who was missing was found “relatively close” to the other victims, but it was impossible to see them because there were white-out conditions on Tuesday when the others were located.The recovery efforts had been put on hold for several days because of heavy snow and the threat of more avalanches. Helicopters with the California National Guard and California Highway Patrol recovered the bodies on Saturday morning by hoisting them from the mountain and bringing them to nearby snowcats — trucks outfitted for transportation on the snow. \n    \n        \n    \n\nOfficials said on Friday that they were using water to break up the snow in the area as avalanche mitigation work, a technique that is designed to intentionally release unstable snowpack to reduce the risk when rescue crews go in.The mitigation and search efforts have included California Highway Patrol air operations, Nevada County Sheriff’s search and rescue, Tahoe Nordic search and rescue, the utility company Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, the Sierra avalanche center and others.",

        "title": "Ski guides in spotlight as investigators probe deadly California avalanche",
        "text": "A closed sign is partially buried at the entrance to the Castle Peak trailhead in Soda Springs, Calif., Friday, Feb. 20, 2026. (Stephen Lam/San Francisco Chronicle via AP)2026-02-21T05:01:04Z\n                                        An investigation to determine if backcountry guides were criminally negligent during a California ski trip that ended with eight people killed in an avalanche and another presumed dead has surprised legal experts, who said the probe has scant precedent.Backcountry tour clients typically sign waivers of liability that shield guides and their companies from potential lawsuits. And skiing is recognized by courts in California as involving certain dangers, attorney Andrew McDevitt said.That means recreational skiers assume certain risks, such as potential collisions with rocks or trees and changing snow conditions.McDevitt and other attorneys in California, Colorado and Utah who handle civil cases resulting from skiing accidents said they had not previously heard of a fatal avalanche during a guided trip that sparked a criminal investigation.\n    \n        \n    \n\nBut this week’s avalanche is drawing a closer look likely because of its scale and the decision to proceed despite forecasts indicating potential avalanches, McDevitt said. The slide was the deadliest in the U.S. since 1981, when 11 climbers were killed on Mount Rainier in Washington state.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nUtah ski injury attorney Rob Miner points out that the waivers signed by backcountry tour clients don’t absolve the guide companies of responsibility if they don’t follow appropriate safety protocols or fail to fully inform their clients of the risks they face.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“They’re guides. It is presumed they will not guide you into an experience that may kill you, or that creates an unreasonable risk of death,” Miner said.The large avalanche hit the group as they skied out of the remote Sierra Nevada wilderness on Tuesday. The victims included three of the four guides from Blackbird Mountain Guides leading the trip. Six people survived.Pivotal moments for investigators may include the guides’ choice to embark on the three-day backcountry trip with 11 clients at a time of heightened avalanche risk, followed by the decision to ski out Tuesday after avalanche conditions had worsened because of a severe storm.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe Nevada County Sheriff’s Office declined to share more information when it announced the investigation Friday. A state agency that regulates workplace safety also said it opened an investigation into the tragedy.The guides’ decisions — and how they were communicated with their clients — also could shape the outcome of any lawsuits filed over the deaths, attorneys said. It’s not yet known what access the guides had to the latest weather reports when the group started to ski out.“There’s a lot of speculation,” said attorney Ravn Whitington, who specializes in ski injury and wrongful death cases in Truckee, California, near where the avalanche happened. “What investigators know at Nevada County Search and Rescue, the Nevada County Sheriff’s Office and the Nevada County District Attorney’s Office are just not known to the public.”Blackbird Mountain Guides said in a statement that the four guides were certified in backcountry skiing and were avalanche education instructors. The company said its guides stay in touch with senior employees at Blackbird’s base during trips to go over conditions and potential routes.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“There is still a lot that we’re learning about what happened. It’s too soon to draw conclusions, but investigations are underway,” the company said.The 15 skiers began their trip Sunday, just as warnings about the storm were intensifying. By early Tuesday, officials cautioned that avalanches were expected. Safety experts say it is not uncommon for backcountry skiers to go out when there is an avalanche watch or even a more serious avalanche warning.The families of the six Blackbird clients who were killed said that the trip was well organized in advance and the victims were equipped with avalanche safety equipment. “They were trained and prepared for backcountry travel and trusted their professional guides on this trip,” the families said in a Thursday statement.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                MATTHEW BROWN\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Brown is based in Billings, Montana.

        "text": "President Donald Trump speaks during a press briefing at the White House, Friday, Feb. 20, 2026, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)2026-02-21T16:29:50Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday that he wants a global tariff of 15%, up from 10% he had announced a day earlier after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down many of the far-reaching taxes on imports that he had imposed over the last year. Trump’s announcement on social media was the latest sign that despite the court’s check on his powers, the Republican president still intends to ratchet up tariffs in an unpredictable way. Tariffs have been his favorite tool for rewriting the rules of global commerce and applying international pressure. The court’s decision on Friday struck down tariffs that Trump had imposed on nearly every country using an emergency powers law. Trump now said he will use a different, albeit more limited, legal authority. He’s already signed an executive order enabling him to bypass Congress and impose a 10% tax on imports from around the world, starting on Tuesday, the same day as his State of the Union speech. However, those tariffs are limited to 150 days unless they are extended legislatively.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a message inquiring when the president would sign an updated order to peg the tariffs at 15%.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nHe wrote on social media that he was making the announcement “based on a thorough, detailed, and complete review of the ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American decision on Tariffs issued yesterday.”\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nBy a 6-3 vote, the justices ruled that it was unconstitutional for Trump to unilaterally set and change tariffs because the power to tax lies with Congress. In addition to the temporary tariffs that Trump wants to set at 15%, the president said Friday that he was also pursuing tariffs through other sections of federal law which require an investigation by the Commerce Department.He wrote on Saturday that “during the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nAfter the Supreme Court decision, Trump made an unusually personal attack on the justices who ruled against him in a 6-3 vote, including two of those he appointed during his first term, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. Trump, at a news conference on Friday, said that the situation is “an embarrassment to their families.”He was still seething Friday night, posting on social media complaining about Gorsuch, Coney Barrett and Chief Justice John Roberts, who ruled with the majority and wrote the majority opinion. On Saturday morning, Trump issued another post declaring that his “new hero” was Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote a 63-page dissent. He also praised Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, who were in the minority, and said of the three dissenting justices: “There is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they want to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”Tariffs have been central to Trump’s economic policies, which he has said address a host of ills, from reviving trade imbalances and reviving U.S. manufacturing to forcing other nations to action, whether it be stepping up efforts to combat drug trafficking or ceasing hostilities with each other.\n    \n        \n    \n\nHe also regularly claimed despite evidence to the contrary that foreign governments would pay the tariffs—not American consumers and businesses.Federal data shows the Treasury had collected more than $133 billion from the import taxes the president has imposed under the emergency powers law as of December, and Trump has made many promises about what that money might go toward, such as paying down the national debt and sending dividend checks to taxpayers. The Supreme Court decision did not address what happens to the funds that have already been collected from tariffs. Democrats spoke out quickly on Trump’s new tariff threat. Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee accused Trump of “pickpocketing the American people” with his newly announced higher tariff. “A little over 24 hours after his tariffs were ruled illegal, he’s doing anything he can to make sure he can still jack up your costs,” they wrote on social media.California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Trump nemesis, added that “he does not care about you.”______AP reporter Ali Swenson contributed to this story._\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                MICHELLE L.

        "text": "Michelob ULTRA, the official beer sponsor of Team USA, brought a celebratory, fan-centric experience to Park City, Utah, highlighting the 2026 winter sports and Team USA's historic return to the ice and slopes. A spirited blend of competitive sports and après-ski lifestyle, the VIP ULTRA Summit party and weeklong ULTRA Base activation, powered by TCL, treated fans to world-class entertainment and an immersive communal hub to experience the legacy of Team USA in a superior format.Kicking off February 20, Michelob ULTRA's VIP experience, ULTRA Summit, transformed the Park City's mountain ranges by bringing back night skiing for one night only. For the first time since 2017, fans took to the mountainside to ski down the same slopes as their favorite athletes, following the return of the nighttime skiing tradition. Appearances by Joey Graziadei, Tyler Cameron, Josh Brubaker and Camille Kostek, signaled a star-studded roster to highlight hockey’s evolving fanbase and influence on pop culture.Blending the intersection of sports and music with an anticipated, high-octane set by Norwegian EDM artist Kygo, the VIP event marked the producer's second return to the winter sports since the 2016 Rio Ceremony. Held at the Red Pine Lodge Summit, Kygo’s futurist set lit up the slopes and set the tone for Michelob ULTRA’s Base camp celebrations.This sentiment carried through the activation's nostalgia-tinged exhibition, which displayed iconic memorabilia and legendary artifacts, such as a signed USA Hockey jersey signed by Mike Eruzione — nodding to the \"Miracle on Ice\" victory of the 1980 winter sports. Jerseys, apparel and photography captured the grit and tenacity of Team USA Hockey.Off the slopes, ULTRA Village created an elevated après-ski, lively area to host watch parties while cheering on Team USA, including interactive curling games, curated photo opps, dedicated Michelob ULTRA bars and more.With the 2026 winter sports officially coming to a close, Michelob ULTRA brought USA fans together for an experience that extended past the broadcast games on screens, inviting them to dive into the heart of the action and pay homage to Team USA’s storied legacy during closing ceremony weekend and the communities that continue to define winter sports.Stay in the loop on more ULTRA Superior Access experiences by visiting the brand's website.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "President Donald Trump speaks during a press briefing at the White House, Friday, Feb. 20, 2026, in Washington, as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik, looks on. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)2026-02-21T20:58:28Z\n                                        NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase acknowledged for the first time that it closed the bank accounts of President Donald Trump and several of his businesses in the political and legal aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021 attacks on the U.S. Capitol, the latest development in a legal saga over the controversial practice of “debanking.” The acknowledgment came in a court filing submitted this week in Trump’s lawsuit against the bank and its leader, Jamie Dimon. The president sued for $5 billion, alleging that his accounts were closed for political reasons, disrupting his business operations. “In February 2021, JPMorgan informed Plaintiffs that certain accounts maintained with JPMorgan’s CB and PB would be closed,” JPMorgan’s former chief administrative officer Dan Wilkening wrote in the court filing. The “PB” and “CB” stands for JPMorgan’s private bank and commercial bank. \n    \n        \n    \n\nUntil now, JPMorgan has never admitted it closed the president’s accounts, and would only speak hypothetically about when the bank closes accounts and its reasons for closing accounts. Emails and text messages to a spokesman for the bank were not returned. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nTrump originally sued JPMorgan in Florida state court, where Trump’s primary residence is now located. JPMorgan Chase is looking to have the case moved to New York, which is where the bank accounts were located and where Trump kept much of his business operations until recently. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nTrump accuses the bank of trade libel and accuses Dimon himself of violating Florida’s Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act.In the original lawsuit, Trump alleges he tried to raise the issue personally with Dimon after the bank started to close his accounts, and that Dimon assured Trump he would figure out what was happening. The lawsuit alleges Dimon failed to follow up with Trump. Further, Trump’s lawyers allege that JPMorgan placed the president and his companies on a reputational “blacklist” that both JPMorgan and other banks use to keep clients from opening accounts with them in the future.\n    \n        \n    \n\nJPMorgan has previously said it believes the suit has no merit.Debanking occurs when a bank closes the accounts of a customer or refuses to do business with a customer in the form of loans or other services. Once a relatively obscure issue in finance, debanking has become a politically charged issue in recent years, with conservative politicians arguing that banks have discriminated against them and their affiliated interests.“In a devastating concession that proves President Trump’s entire claim, JPMorgan Chase admitted to unlawfully and intentionally de-banking President Trump, his family, and his businesses, causing overwhelming financial harm,” the president’s lawyers said in a statement. President Trump is standing up for all those wrongly debanked by JPMorgan Chase and its cohorts, and will see this case to a just and proper conclusion.”Debanking first became a national issue when conservatives accused the Obama administration of pressuring banks to stop extending services to gun stores and payday lenders under “Operation Choke Point.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nTrump and other conservative figures have alleged that banks cut them off from their accounts under the umbrella term of “reputational risk” after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Since Trump came back into office, the president’s banking regulators have moved to stop any banks from using “reputational risk” as a reason for denying service to customers.This is not the first lawsuit Trump has filed against a big bank alleging that he was debanked. The Trump Organization sued credit card giant Capital One in March 2025 for similar reasons and allegations. The case is ongoing. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                KEN SWEET\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Ken is a national writer on banking and consumer issues.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto",

        "title": "White House dinner closes a turbulent week for governors in Washington",
        "text": "Gov. Wes Moore, D-Md., right, attends a breakfast with the National Governors Association in the State Dining Room of the White House, Friday, Feb. 20, 2026, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)2026-02-21T13:30:54Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — The annual dinner with governors at the White House is typically a chance for leaders from both parties to come together, socialize and spend a low-key evening with the president. But like many traditions during President Donald Trump’s second term, Saturday’s dinner has proven unusually controversial. Ahead of this week’s gathering of the National Governors Association, Trump ridiculed the bipartisan group’s leadership, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma and Democratic Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland. He refused to invite Moore, along with Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, to a working event at the White House on Friday — only to relent at the last minute.Even then, the event was cut short when Trump learned of the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down his sweeping tariff policy, leaving even some Republicans frustrated by the week’s turbulence. \n    \n        \n    \n\n“It was unfortunate that the Supreme Court came out with a bad ruling at that time,” said Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican and top Trump ally.Dozens of Democrats had threatened to boycott the dinner if members of their party were blocked from the working meeting. But even after Moore’s attendance, some said they still wouldn’t show up Saturday.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n“President Trump has made this whole thing a farce,” Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said in a statement explaining her decision to skip the dinner. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nFor all the turmoil surrounding the dinner, some Democrats said Friday’s meeting was useful. Moore said it offered a “chance for us to be able to share our thoughts and our perspectives and our ideas.”New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said governors asked Trump what lessons were learned from the administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement in Minnesota, in which two U.S. citizens were killed within weeks of each other.“The President said, ‘We’ll only go where we’re wanted,” Hochul said approvingly.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThose who have attended previous dinners said they offered a rare and helpful opportunity for governors to connect with the president and members of his Cabinet away from the pressure of daily governing. Some also said the dinner was a chance to connect with fellow governors from other parties whom they might not see very often. Asa Hutchinson, the former Republican governor of Arkansas who briefly challenged Trump for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, recalled being assigned to a table one year with then-Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo and getting to know her family.“It’s a glowing evening in the White House,” Hutchinson, who once chaired the NGA, said in an interview. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JOEY CAPPELLETTI\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Cappelletti covers Congress for The Associated Press.
