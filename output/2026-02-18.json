If none of the candidates gets 50% of the vote there will be a runoff in June between the top two contenders.Lawmakers in Peru have gained increasing leverage over the nation’s executive branch over the past decade, using corruption investigations to remove presidents who have struggled to build congressional majorities.A clause in Peru’s constitution that allows presidents to be removed if they are found “morally incapable” of leading the country has been broadly interpreted by legislators and has been used several times to vote presidents out of office. Boluarte, Jerí’s predecessor, lasted almost three years in office and survived violent protests in which police killed dozens of protesters. But she eventually was removed on moral incapacity grounds, with lawmakers citing the high crime rate and corruption scandals. \n    \n        \n    \n\nPedro Castillo, a leftist union leaders who won the 2021 presidential election, was voted out of office by legislators in late 2022 after he tried to dissolve congress in order to skirt anti-corruption proceedings. Last year Castillo was sentenced to 11 years in prison for trying to overthrow the nation’s institutions.___Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n                    \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n                    \n    获取更多RSS：https://feedx.net https://feedx.site",

        "title": "What to know about the ‘equal time’ rule Stephen Colbert says led CBS to pull his Talarico interview",
        "text": "Stephen Colbert attends the 36th Annual PaleyFest &quot;An Evening with Stephen Colbert&quot; in Los Angeles on March 16, 2019. (Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File)2026-02-17T21:04:02Z\n                                        Stephen Colbert’s comments that network executives pulled his interview with Democratic Texas Senate candidate James Talarico over fears it would violate regulatory guidance from the Trump administration has prompted a conversation about the rules governing how media outlets treat political coverage.The concern about the interview, which the late-night host referenced in his Monday night show and later posted in full online, stems from a requirement that broadcast stations give equal time to political candidates when they appear on-air. Although there are multiple exemptions to the provision, the Trump administration through the Federal Communications Commission — which regulates the nation’s airwaves — has been moving to clamp down specifically on programs like Colbert’s, which the agency has suggested may be “motivated by partisan purposes.”\n    \n        \n    \n\n“He was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network’s lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,” Colbert said on his program, ”The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”In a statement issued Tuesday, CBS said Colbert’s show “was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates” in the March 3 Democratic primary, “and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled.” Thereafter, the network noted, it was decided “to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.”Talarico, a critic of President Donald Trump, posted a nearly minute-long clip of his interview with Colbert on X and called it “the interview Donald Trump didn’t want you to see.”\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nWhat does equal time mean?The Communications Act of 1934, the wide-ranging legislation that for nearly a century has broadly governed use of the nation’s airwaves, includes a provision that applies specifically to coverage of political candidates. If a station gives airtime to one candidate, then the same station must offer comparable time to other candidates competing in the given contest, should they ask for it. It also delves into campaign advertising airtime sold by stations and networks. If a station sells airtime to one candidate, then it also has to offer to sell the same amount of time to other candidates for the same office.There are exceptions to this rule, including newscasts, “bona fide” interview programs, coverage of live events or documentaries. But if candidates host TV shows or appear in non-news, entertainment programming, that does trigger the provision.Equal time also only applies to broadcast television and radio. So pieces on cable, streaming services or social media aren’t included.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nHow the Trump administration has treated equal timeThe rule requiring networks to give equal time to political candidates hasn’t traditionally been applied to talk shows, but the Trump administration has made moves to change that. In January, the Federal Communications Commission issued new guidance warning late-night and daytime hosts that they need to give political candidates equal time, with FCC Chairman Brendan Carr questioning the talk show exemption and positing that hosts were “motivated by partisan purposes.”“The FCC has not been presented with any evidence that the interview portion of any late night or daytime television talk show program on air presently would qualify for the bona fide news exemption,” according to the public notice.\n    \n        \n    \n\nFCC eyes talk shows like ‘The View’The notice also said that television networks would need to apply for exemptions for individual programs.In his comments, Colbert noted that the equal time provision applies to broadcast but not streaming platforms. Subsequently, his nearly 15-minute interview with Talarico was posted to the YouTube page for Colbert’s show, with the host noting specifically that the segment was only appearing online and not on broadcast.\n    \n        \n    \n\nCarr, appointed by Trump to lead the agency last year, has often criticized network talk shows, suggesting last year that probing ABC’s “The View” — whose hosts have frequently been critical of Trump — over the exemption might be “worthwhile.”The FCC did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Tuesday.\n    \n        \n    \n\nWhat about the Fairness Doctrine?Created by the FCC in 1949, this rule mandated that broadcasters present contrasting viewpoints when covering publicly important and controversial issues. Unlike the equal time provision of the Communications Act, this was an FCC rule, not a law.It didn’t apply specifically to political candidates, but topics. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the doctrine on a First Amendment challenge in 1969, with the court writing that the limited availability of broadcast spectrum justified regulation. In 1987, the FCC repealed the rule, arguing that spectrum scarcity was no longer an issue, and then-President Ronald Reagan vetoed Congress’ attempt to codify it into law.___Associated Press reporter David Bauder contributed to this report. ___Kinnard can be reached at http://x.com/MegKinnardAP\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                MEG KINNARD\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Kinnard covers national politics for The Associated Press.

        "text": "Snow falls on Tuesday, Feb. 17, 2026 in Truckee Calif. (AP Photos/Brooke Hess-Homeier)2026-02-17T21:26:06Z\n                                        SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Six backcountry skiers were found alive and 10 others were still missing Tuesday after an avalanche in Northern California during a powerful winter storm moving through the state. Search and rescue crews were dispatched to the Castle Peak area, northwest of Lake Tahoe, after someone called 911 to report an avalanche with people buried. Ashley Quadros, a spokesperson with the Nevada County Sheriff’s Office, said the six skiers located were still awaiting rescue. Quadros said the survivors were asked to shelter in place “as best they can” while search and rescue ski teams reach them.She said there are 46 emergency first responders trying to reach them.The group included four ski guides with 12 clients, Quadros said. The Nevada County Sheriff’s Office received a 911 call at about 11:30 a.m. from someone reporting an avalanche with people buried, Quadros said. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe sheriff’s office, the sheriff’s Search &amp; Rescue team and a crew with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection combed the area of Castle Peak, which is northwest of Lake Tahoe, Quadros said. California is being walloped this week by a powerful winter storm carrying treacherous thunderstorms, high winds and heavy snow in mountain areas. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nAccording to the Sierra Avalanche Center of the Tahoe National Forest based in Truckee, the area in the Central Sierra Nevada, including the Greater Lake Tahoe region, was facing high avalanche danger in the backcountry with large slides expected to occur Tuesday and into Wednesday. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe dangerous conditions were caused by rapidly accumulating snowfall piling on already fragile snowpack layers coupled with gale-force winds. Several ski resorts around Lake Tahoe were fully or partially closed due to the extreme weather. The resorts along highways have avalanche mitigation programs and were not expected to be at as high of a risk as the backcountry where travel in, near, or below the avalanche terrain was strongly discouraged, the center said.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“It’s particularly dangerous in the backcountry right now just because we’re at the height of the storm,” said Brandon Schwartz, Tahoe National Forest lead avalanche forecaster at the center.Experts rely on people who witness an avalanche or its aftermath to know when and where an avalanche has occurred, Schwartz said. Castle Peak, a 9,110-foot (2,777-meter) peak in the Donner Summit area of the Sierra Nevada, is a popular backcountry skiing destination. In the nearby town of Soda Springs, at least 30 inches (76 centimeters) of snow had fallen in the last 24 hours, according to the Soda Springs Mountain Resort. Forecasters said the western slope of the Sierra Nevada in northern Shasta County — including portions of Interstate 5 — and parts of the state’s Pacific Coast Range could see up to 8 feet (2.4 meters) of snow before the storm moves through late Wednesday.The storm wreaked havoc on roadways spanning from Sonoma County to the Sierra Nevada. Traffic was halted temporarily in both directions on I-80 near the Nevada state line due to spinouts and crashes, the California Department of Transportation reported.In January, an avalanche in the region buried a snowmobiler in snow and killed him, authorities said. Each winter, 25 to 30 people die in avalanches in the U.S., according to the National Avalanche Center. _____Watson reported from San Diego. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JULIE WATSON\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Watson covers immigration, US-Mexico border issues and the environment, and helps direct coverage of California and Nevada for The Associated Press.

        "title": "We’re Measuring Data Center Sustainability Wrong",
        "text": "In 2024, Google claimed that their data centers are 1.5x more energy efficient than industry average. In 2025, Microsoft committed billions to nuclear power for AI workloads. The data center industry tracks power usage effectiveness to three decimal places and optimizes water usage intensity with machine precision. We report direct emissions and energy emissions with religious fervor.These are laudable advances, but these metrics account for only 30 percent of total emissions from the IT sector. The majority of the emissions are not directly from data centers or the energy they use, but from the end-user devices that actually access the data centers, emissions due to manufacturing the hardware, and software inefficiencies. We are frantically optimizing less than a third of the IT sector’s environmental impact, while the bulk of the problem goes unmeasured.Incomplete regulatory frameworks are part of the problem. In Europe, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) now requires 11,700 companies to report emissions using these incomplete frameworks. The next phase of the directive, covering 40,000+ additional companies, was originally scheduled for 2026 (but is likely delayed to 2028). In the United States, the standards body responsible for IT sustainability metrics (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 39) is conducting active revision of its standards through 2026, with a key plenary meeting in May 2026.The time to act is now. If we don’t fix the measurement frameworks, we risk locking in incomplete data collection and optimizing a fraction of what matters for the next 5 to 10 years, before the next major standards revision.The limited metricsWalk into any modern data center and you’ll see sustainability instrumentation everywhere. Power usage efficiency (PUE) monitors track every watt. Water usage efficiency (WUE) systems measure water consumption down to the gallon. Sophisticated monitoring captures everything from server utilization to cooling efficiency to renewable energy percentages.But here’s what those measurements miss: End-user devices globally emit 1.5 to 2 times more carbon than all data centers combined, according to McKinsey’s 2022 report. The smartphones, laptops, and tablets we use to access those ultra-efficient data centers are the bigger problem.Data center operations, as measured by power usage efficiency, account for only 24 percent of the total emissions.On the conservative end of the range from McKinsey’s report, devices emit 1.5 times as much as data centers. That means that data centers make up 40 percent of total IT emissions, while devices make up 60 percent.On top of that, approximately 75 percent of device emissions occur not during use, but during manufacturing—this is so-called embodied carbon. For data centers, only 40 percent is embodied carbon, and 60 percent comes from operations (as measured by PUE).Putting this together, data center operations, as measured by PUE, account for only 24 percent of the total emissions. Data center embodied carbon is 16 percent, device embodied carbon is 45 percent, and device operation is 15 percent.Under the EU’s current CSRD framework, companies must report their emissions in three categories: direct emissions from owned sources, indirect emissions from purchased energy, and a third category for everything else.This “everything else” category does include device emissions and embodied carbon. However, those emissions are reported as aggregate totals broken down by accounting category—Capital Goods, Purchased Goods and Services, Use of Sold Products—but not by product type. How much comes from end-user devices versus datacenter infrastructure, or employee laptops versus network equipment, remains murky, and therefore, unoptimized.Embodied carbon and hardware reuseManufacturing a single smartphone generates approximately 50 kg CO2 equivalent (CO2e). For a laptop, it’s 200 kg CO2e. With 1 billion smartphones replaced annually, that’s 50 million tonnes of CO2e per year just from smartphone manufacturing, before anyone even turns them on. On average, smartphones are replaced every 2 years, laptops every 3 to 4 years, and printers every 5 years. Data center servers are replaced approximately every 5 years.Extending smartphone lifecycles to 3 years instead of 2 would reduce annual manufacturing emissions by 33 percent. At scale, this dwarfs data center optimization gains.There are programs geared towards reusing old components that are still functional and integrating them into new servers. GreenSKUs and similar initiatives show 8 percent reductions in embodied carbon are achievable. But these remain pilot programs, not systematic approaches. And critically, they’re measured only in data center context, not across the entire IT stack.Imagine applying the same circular economy principles to devices. With over 2 billion laptops in existence globally and 2-3-year replacement cycles, even modest lifespan extensions create massive emission reductions. Extending smartphone lifecycles to 3 years instead of 2 would reduce annual manufacturing emissions by 33 percent. At scale, this dwarfs data center optimization gains.Yet data center reuse gets measured, reported, and optimized. Device reuse doesn’t, because the frameworks don’t require it.The invisible role of softwareLeading load balancer infrastructure across IBM Cloud, I see how software architecture decisions ripple through energy consumption. Inefficient code doesn’t just slow things down—it drives up both data center power consumption and device battery drain.For example, University of Waterloo researchers showed that they can reduce 30 percent of energy use in data centers by changing just 30 lines of code. From my perspective, this result is not an anomaly—it’s typical. Bad software architecture forces unnecessary data transfers, redundant computations, and excessive resource use. But unlike data center efficiency, there’s no commonly accepted metric for software efficiency.This matters more now than ever. With AI workloads driving massive data center expansion—projected to consume 6.7-12 percent of total U.S. electricity by 2028, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory—software efficiency becomes critical.What needs to changeThe solution isn’t to stop measuring data center efficiency. It’s to measure device sustainability with the same rigor. Specifically, standards bodies (particularly ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 39 WG4: Holistic Sustainability Metrics) should extend frameworks to include device lifecycle tracking, software efficiency metrics, and hardware reuse standards.To track device lifecycles, we need standardized reporting of device embodied carbon, broken out separately by device. One aggregate number in an “everything else” category is insufficient. We need specific device categories with manufacturing emissions and replacement cycles visible.To include software efficiency, I advocate developing a PUE-equivalent for software, such as energy per transaction, per API call, or per user session. This needs to be a reportable metric under sustainability frameworks so companies can demonstrate software optimization gains.To encourage hardware reuse, we need to systematize reuse metrics across the full IT stack—servers and devices. This includes tracking repair rates, developing large-scale refurbishment programs, and tracking component reuse with the same detail currently applied to data center hardware.To put it all together, we need a unified IT emission-tracking dashboard. CSRD reporting should show device embodied carbon alongside data center operational emissions, making the full IT sustainability picture visible at a glance.These aren’t radical changes—they’re extensions of measurement principles already proven in data center context. The first step is acknowledging what we’re not measuring. The second is building the frameworks to measure it. And the third is demanding that companies report the complete picture—data centers and devices, servers and smartphones, infrastructure and software.Because you can’t fix what you can’t see. And right now, we’re not seeing 70 percent of the problem.",

        "title": "Fallout from Epstein and Mandelson puts Britain’s House of Lords under scrutiny",
        "text": "Members of the House of Lords and guests take their seats in the Lords Chamber, ahead of the State Opening of Parliament, in the Houses of Parliament, in London, July 17, 2024. (Henry Nicholls/POOL via AP, File)2026-02-18T05:12:53Z\n                                        LONDON (AP) — Fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein files has landed on the gilded wood and plush red benches of Britain’s House of Lords.Parliament’s upper chamber is in the spotlight after former U.K. ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson was forced to resign as a member of the Lords because of his friendship with the late sex offender.The episode has emboldened critics who say the unelected house is antiquated, undemocratic and far too slow at punishing bad behavior by its members. Supporters say the chamber of more than 850 members-for-life who sport the titles of “Lord” or “Lady” is an unwieldy but essential part of parliamentary democracy.Almost everyone agrees it needs reform, but that task has eluded successive governments.“It’s a mess,” said Jenny Jones, one of two Green Party members of the Lords. “In spite of our being supposedly a modern democracy, we have a semi-feudal system.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nRelic of the pastFor most of its 700-year history, the House of Lords was composed of noblemen — not women — who inherited their seats, alongside a smattering of bishops. In the 1950s, these were joined by “life peers” — retired politicians, civic leaders and other notables appointed by the government, among them the first female members of the Lords.In 1999, the Labour government of then-Prime Minister Tony Blair evicted most of the more than 750 hereditary peers, though to avoid an aristocrats’ rebellion, 92 were allowed to remain temporarily.A quarter century on, Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s current Labour government finally introduced legislation to oust the remaining “hereditaries,” calling them an indefensible relic of the past. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe lords have put up a fight, forcing a compromise that will see some hereditary members allowed to stay by being “recycled” into life peers.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“Hereditary peers actually work harder than average peers,” said Charles Hay, the 16th Earl of Kinnoull, who leads the group of cross-bench, or non-party affiliated, peers in the Lords. “It means that you chuck out a lot of people who are actually being effective.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nMost agree that the House of Lords plays an important role in reviewing legislation passed by the elected House of Commons. The lords can amend bills and send them back to lawmakers for another look. But when push comes to shove, the upper house is supposed to give way to the will of the elected chamber.Critics say the upper chamber has sometimes overstepped the mark by blocking legislation, as with a current bill to legalize assisted dying. It was approved by the Commons but has become bogged down with hundreds of amendments in the Lords.Lords-a-misbehavingLong gone are the days when out-of-favor lords could be imprisoned in the Tower of London or beheaded for treason.Until recently there was little parliamentary authorities could do about peers who commit ethical breaches or crimes.Lord Archer of Weston-Super-Mare, otherwise known as the thriller-writer Jeffrey Archer, was imprisoned for perjury in 2001, while Lord Black of Crossharbour — the media baron Conrad Black — served a U.S. prison sentence after a 2007 fraud conviction. Under the rules of the time, neither could be kicked out of the Lords.\n    \n        \n    \n\nSince then, the law has been changed to allow members to be expelled for breaching the Lords code of conduct, imprisonment or non-attendance. To this day, no one has been expelled for bad behavior, though a couple have quit before being kicked out, including one who committed sexual assault and another filmed allegedly snorting cocaine with sex workers.Ex-peers get to keep their lordly titles and the cachet they bring. Mandelson — who in one message asked Epstein: “Need a Lord on the board?” — has lost his job and faces a police investigation for misconduct in public office. But he remains Lord Mandelson.Also under pressure is Starmer’s former chief of staff Matthew Doyle, now Lord Doyle, appointed to the House of Lords despite his friendship with a man later jailed for possessing indecent images of children.Removing disgraced lords’ titles would require new legislation, something that has not been done since 1917, when several lords were stripped of their titles for siding with Germany in World War I.\n    \n        \n    \n\nSlow pace of changeLabour remains committed to eventually replacing the House of Lords with an alternative second chamber that is “more representative of the U.K.”But change is slow. In December, the Lords set up a committee to look at introducing a retirement age of 80 and tightening up the participation requirement.“Lords reform is glacial,” said Meg Russell, a politics professor who heads the Constitution Unit at University College London. “Things are talked about for decades before they happen.”The fall of Mandelson, who was appointed to the Lords in 2008 by a previous Labour government, has renewed concern about the quality of members and the way they are selected. Anger among Labour lawmakers about Mandelson escalated into a crisis for Starmer that could yet end his leadership.\n    \n        \n    \n\nRussell says the Mandelson and Doyle controversies show the need to change the way Lords members are chosen. While crossbenchers are appointed by an independent committee, most life peerages are handed out by the prime minister, often to reward aides, allies and donors.“There’s really no proper quality check and there’s no limit on numbers and it just looks so anachronistic,” she said. “It’s clear that there ought to be more rigorous processes to check people on the way in.”The Green Party that Jones represents wants to go further and abolish the Lords, replacing it with an elected upper house.“We should call it the Senate or something and stop this ridiculous class-based nomenclature,” said Jones, whose formal title is Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb. “I’d be happy to be called senator and not lady.”\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JILL LAWLESS\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Lawless is based in London, covering British politics, diplomacy and culture and top stories from the UK and beyond.

        "title": "New Mexico legislators launch ‘truth commission’ investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s secluded ranch",
        "text": "The entrance of the San Rafael Ranch, which was previously owned by Jeffrey Epstein and called the Zorro Ranch, is seen, Jan. 31, 2026, near Stanley, N.M. (AP Photo/Savannah Peters)2026-02-17T20:19:57Z\n                                        SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — State legislators in New Mexico launched an investigation Tuesday into past activity at a secluded desert ranch where financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein once entertained guests and whether local authorities looked the other way.A bipartisan, four-member panel of state House representatives is investigating allegations that the ranch may have facilitated sexual abuse and sex trafficking. New Mexico lawmakers also say they want to know why Epstein was not registered as a sex offender after pleading guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl and whether there was corruption among public officials.Democratic state Rep. Marianna Anaya of Albuquerque, a member of the truth commission, urged people during a news conference Tuesday to come forward with information about any abuse at the ranch linked to Epstein and other people who may have it possible.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“That perpetrator could not act alone. They could not run a sex ring alone, they could not commit these types of financial crimes alone. So we know as a commission that enablers must also be held accountable, including the state itself, if needed,” said Anaya. “If you do want to share, we’ll be here and we will be operating with confidentiality.”\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nRevelations of ties to Epstein have led to the departure or ousting of multiple high-profile people in recent days. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nEpstein purchased the sprawling Zorro Ranch in New Mexico in 1993 from former Democratic Gov. Bruce King and built a 26,700-square-foot (2,480-square-meter) hilltop mansion with a private runway. The property was sold by Epstein’s estate in 2023 — with proceeds going toward creditors — to the family of Don Huffines, a Republican candidate in Texas for election to the office of state comptroller. In a social media post on X, Huffines said the property has been renamed San Rafael Ranch after a saint associated with healing and that his family plans to operate a Christian retreat there.\n    \n        \n    \n\nHuffines said any request by law enforcement for access would be met with immediate and full cooperation.Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial in 2019 on charges that he sexually abused and trafficked dozens of underage girls.Truth commission chairwoman and state Rep. Andrea Romero of Santa Fe has said that several survivors of Epstein’s abuse have signaled that sex trafficking activity extended to the ranch, which is about 35 miles (56 kilometers) south of Santa Fe.“We’ve heard years of allegations and rumors about Epstein’s activities here. But unfortunately, federal investigations have failed to put together an official record,” Romero said Tuesday. “This truth commission will finally fill in the gaps of what we need to know.”Commission members also include retired FBI agent and Republican state Rep. William Hall of Aztec and former district attorney and Rep. Andrea Reeb of Clovis. State House legislators who were present voted unanimously on Monday to create the commission with subpoena power and a budget of over $2 million. \n    \n        \n    \n\nWhile Epstein never faced charges in New Mexico, the state attorney general’s office in 2019 confirmed that it was investigating and had interviewed possible victims who visited the ranch. In 2023, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez ordered an investigation into financial businesses utilized by Epstein and their legal obligations, resulting in agreements with two banks that dedicate $17 million to the prevention of human trafficking, according to a spokesperson for Torrez’s office.",

        "text": "The Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul, Minn. is seen Tuesday, Feb. 17, 2026, the opening day of the state&#x27;s 2026 legislative session. (AP Photo/Steve Karnowski)2026-02-17T18:36:09Z\n                                        ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Democrats hope to rein in the power of federal immigration officers in Minnesota as the state’s legislative session gets underway Tuesday, while Republicans will focus on combatting fraud in taxpayer-funded programs that President Donald Trump cited to justify the recent immigration enforcement surge.While White House border czar Tom Homan said over the weekend that more than 1,000 officers have left the Twin Cities area, and hundreds more will depart in the days ahead, the aftermath will continue to reverberate at the state Capitol during the session, which runs through late May.Close divisions will require compromise to pass an\n    \n        \n    \n\nythingIt’s unclear whether any significant changes can pass the closely divided Legislature. The House is tied with a Republican speaker, while Democrats hold only a one-vote majority in the Senate. So nothing can pass without bipartisan support. And it’s an election year, with all 201 legislative seats on the ballot. House Speaker Lisa Demuth is among the GOP candidates running for governor and has expressed hope she will win Trump’s endorsement. All of that could make compromise difficult.“There are definitely going to be priorities on both sides of the aisle. ... But when it comes right down to it, we need to have bipartisan votes to move bills through the committees and get the work done for Minnesotans,” Demuth told reporters Monday.Capitol security is tighter this session following the assassination of Democratic former House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband last summer. All visitors now undergo weapons screening.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nDemocrats propose restrictions on ICEDemocratic Gov. Tim Walz last week proposed a $10 million package of relief for small businesses that lost customers and workers during the surge, and more aid proposals could be coming.Just ahead of the session, House and Senate Democrats unveiled 11 bills to counter what they consider some of the worst excesses by federal immigration officers during the surge. They’re meant to keep federal officers away from schools, childcare centers, hospitals and colleges. They would also ban federal agents from wearing face masks, while requiring them to display visible identification. They would also require that federal authorities allow state investigators to participate in investigations of shootings by federal agents, such as the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. The state remains frozen out of those cases. The FBI officially notified the state Monday that it won’t share information or evidence from its investigation into Pretti’s death.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe top House Democrat, Zack Stephenson, said they don’t expect support from Republican leaders, but they’re hoping some GOP lawmakers will break with their party.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“What we’ve seen these last six weeks has been so exceptional, so damaging, that I don’t know how you can be human and not respond to it,” Stephenson said. “But even if it’s not that, we also know it’s an election year and voters are watching, and voters will hold people accountable if they don’t stand up to this administration.”Stephenson also acknowledged that any restrictions the state tries to impose on federal law enforcement are likely to be challenged in court.“But some things are worth fighting for,” Stephenson added. “And if we’re not going to fight for this, what are we doing here?”\n    \n        \n    \n\nRepublicans seek to shift focus to fighting fraudRepublican have expressed little enthusiasm for taking on federal authorities and hope to shift the focus to fighting fraud.“Minnesotans want our state and local law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement,” said Rep. Harry Niska, the No. 2 House Republican.One of the top GOP anti-fraud priorities is legislation to create an independent Office of Inspector General to investigate and prevent the misuse of public funds. The Senate passed a similar proposal last year on a bipartisan 60-7 vote. House Democratic leaders blocked a vote at the end of the session, but the proposal remains alive this year. Republicans also want to require more accountability for agencies and officials who let fraud happen on their watch.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                STEVE KARNOWSKI\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Karnowski covers politics and government from Minnesota for The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib)2026-02-17T20:24:03Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. Capitol Police in Washington, D.C., arrested an 18-year-old man Tuesday after he ran from his vehicle toward the west side of the Capitol Building armed with a shotgun. Capital Police Chief Michael Sullivan said the unidentified man parked a Mercedes SUV near the Capitol, got out and ran “several hundred yards” toward the building before officers intercepted him and ordered him to the ground. Speaking at a press conference following the arrest, Sullivan said the gunman was wearing a tactical vest and gloves and had a Kevlar helmet and gas mask in the vehicle. The shotgun was loaded and he had additional rounds on him, the chief said. Sullivan said the motive was under investigation, including whether members of Congress were the target. Congress is not in session. Sullivan said the department has video footage, but he asked the public for any footage they might have of the incident. “Who knows what would have happened if we wouldn’t have officers standing here?” the chief said, adding that the department had run active shooter drills in almost the identical spot in recent months. Sullivan said the young man was not known to authorities and described him as not being from the area. The chief said the vehicle was not registered to the suspect, who has multiple addresses. There have been incidents at the Capitol in recent years, including a Capitol Police arrest in 2023 where an Atlanta man armed with a rifle was spotted in a park near the Senate. Tuesday’s arrest comes one week before President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address before Congress. Sullivan said the incident does not change the agency’s plans. “We take the State of the Union very, very seriously,” he said. Crime in Washington is down considerably so far in 2026 from 2025, a year when there was a huge drop-off from the previous year. Trump declared an emergency in the city last August to battle crime, leading to the deployment of more than 2,000 National Guard members as well as thousands of federal law enforcement officers and agents. The officers and agents are still throughout the city. Last week, a Washington man was killed in an encounter with U.S. Marshals Service members. Authorities said the marshals were responding to a call about a person threatening to kidnap and hurt someone while holding a gun. Washington activists have asked for more transparency in that incident, which is under investigation by the city’s Metropolitan Police.",

Any hits could identify possible suspects in Guthrie’s disappearance.The 84-year-old mother of NBC “Today” co-anchor Savannah Guthrie was reported missing from her Tucson-area home on Feb. 1 after spending the previous night with family, police said. Her blood was detected on the porch.\n    \n        \n    \n\nA porch camera recorded video of a man with a backpack who was wearing a ski mask, long pants, a jacket and gloves. The FBI said the suspect is about 5 feet, 9 inches (1.75 meters) tall with a medium build.Gloves were found about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from Guthrie’s home. The FBI has said that the gloves appeared to match those worn by the man in the video.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n“There is additional DNA evidence that was found at the residence, and that is also being analyzed,” the sheriff’s department said.In addition, the department said it’s working with experts to try to locate Guthrie by detecting her heart pacemaker. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nParsons Corp. said its BlueFly device, which weighs less than a pound (.45 kilograms) and has a range of up to 218 yards (200 meters), can detect signals from wearable electronics and medical devices. The company said the technology has been used from the air and on the ground in Arizona. It declined further comment about the search. Savannah Guthrie posted an Instagram video Sunday in which she issued an appeal to anyone with information about what happened to her mother.“It is never too late to do the right thing,” she said. “And we are here. And we believe in the essential goodness of every human being, that it’s never too late.”",

        "text": "Attendees participate in the annual Krewe of Muses parade during the Mardi Gras season on Thursday, Feb. 12, 2026, in New Orleans. (Photo by Amy Harris/Invision/AP)2026-02-17T04:59:10Z\n                                        NEW ORLEANS, La. (AP) — As the sun rose in New Orleans Tuesday morning, rows of parade-goers already lined the street. People set up chairs, coolers, grills and ladders — offering a higher vantage point to catch the eye of float riders throwing glimmering plastic beads to revelers.“Happy Mardi Gras,” yelled a marcher in the Half-Fast Walking Club krewe as he tossed a string of white pearly beads into a sea of raised hands.Mardi Gras, also known as Fat Tuesday, marks the climax and end of the weekslong Carnival season and a final chance for indulgence, feasting and revelry before the Christian Lent period of sacrifice and reflection. The joyous goodbye to Carnival always falls on the day before Ash Wednesday. In Louisiana’s most populous city, which is world-famous for its Mardi Gras bash, people donned green, gold and purple outfits, with some opting for an abundance of sequins and others showing off homemade costumes.\n    \n        \n    \n\nAs marching bands passed by, the music echoing through the city streets, people danced and cheered. Others sipped drinks, with many opting for adult concoctions on the day of celebration rather than the usual morning coffee.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nEach parade has its signature “throws” — trinkets that include plastic beads, candy, doubloons, stuffed animals, cups and toys. Hand-decorated coconuts are the coveted item from the parade hosted by the Zulu Social Aide &amp; Pleasure Club.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nSue Mennino was dressed in a white Egyptian-inspired costume, complete with a gold headpiece and translucent cape. Her face was embellished with glitter and electric blue eyeshadow.“The world will be here tomorrow, but today is a day off and a time to party,” Mennino said.The reveler and her husband, also donning a floor-length costume, have celebrated Carnival season for decades as residents of New Orleans. Their Fat Tuesday tradition is to walk through the French Quarter and admire people’s intricate and outrageous costumes.\n    \n        \n    \n\nMennino said while she had lived in other states, including Florida and Massachusetts, the excitement and joy in New Orleans pulled her back to the Bayou State.“Once you have experienced Mardi Gras, how do you not come back?” she said.Carnival events are popular for their spectacular and enormous floats, and also the crafted outfits worn, such as Black masking Indians, whose beaded and bejeweled costumes are topped with feathered headdresses, or parade-goers walking the French Quarter in homemade costumes that capture the unique spirit of the Big Easy. The good times will roll not just in New Orleans but all across the state, from exclusive balls to the Cajun French tradition of the Courir de Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday Run — a rural event in Central Louisiana featuring costumed participants performing, begging for ingredients and chasing live chickens to be cooked in a communal gumbo. Parades are also held in other Gulf Coast cities such as Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida, and there are other world-renowned celebrations in Brazil and Europe.One of the quirkiest is an international Pancake Day competition pitting the women of Liberal, Kansas, against the women of Olney, England. Pancakes are used because they were thought to be a good way for Christians to consume the fat they were supposed to give up during the 40 days before Easter. Contestants must carry a pancake in a frying pan and flip the pancake at the beginning and end of the 415-yard (380-meter) race. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n                    \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n                    \n    获取更多RSS：https://feedx.net https://feedx.site",

        "text": "SummaryBrendon Babenzien is leaving his role as Men's Creative Director at J.CrewThe designer, who joined the retailer in May 2021, is credited with spearheading a successful brand turnaround, where his tenure focused on a \"neo-prep\" aesthetic, reviving 1990s archival styles, and bringing back the iconic J.Crew CatalogBabenzien will continue to run his own label, NoahBrendon Babenzien is set to depart J.Crew, ending a pivotal four-year tenure that reshaped the identity of the classic American retailer. According to recent reports, the designer will step down from his position as Men's Creative Director, a role he has held since 2021. His appointment was seen as a key strategic move to modernize the brand following its emergence from bankruptcy, and his exit marks the conclusion of a chapter defined by a successful return to heritage-inspired menswear.Babenzien, best known as the former design director of Supreme and co-founder of the streetwear label Noah, was hired to inject a sense of \"cool\" back into J.Crew. Under his direction, the menswear line pivoted away from the slim-fit \"Ludlow\" era of the 2010s and embraced a more relaxed, nostalgic aesthetic. Key contributions included the reintroduction of the \"Giant Fit\" chino, a focus on high-quality fabrics like Harris Tweed and Irish linen, and a styling approach that blended traditional preppy codes with a modern street sensibility.Beyond clothing, Babenzien played a crucial role in reviving J.Crew's cultural cachet. He was instrumental in bringing back the beloved physical J.Crew Catalog in 2024, a move that resonated with both long-time fans and a younger generation of shoppers. His final projects included the \"Rollneck Remix,\" a collaboration series that tapped emerging New York designers to reimagine the brand's signature sweaters.Babenzien is expected to shift his full focus back to Noah, the independent label he runs with his wife, Estelle Bailey-Babenzien. J.Crew has not yet named a successor, leaving the menswear division at a crossroads as it seeks to maintain the momentum built during Babenzien's impactful residency.The departure is effective immediately, though specific details regarding the transition remain forthcoming. J.Crew continues to operate under the leadership of CEO Libby Wadle and Women's Creative Director Olympia Gayot, who has similarly been credited with revitalizing the women's business.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "title": "Official 'The Mandalorian and Grogu' Trailer Unmasks Din Djarin and Unleashes a New Hutt Villain",
        "text": "SummaryLucasfilm has released the official full trailer for The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, confirming a May 22, 2026 theatrical releaseThe footage features a major reveal: Pedro Pascal’s Din Djarin is shown fighting without his helmet, marking a significant shift for the characterSigourney Weaver stars as Colonel Ward, a New Republic officer leading the duo on a galaxy-spanning mission while Jeremy Allen White (The Bear) is revealed as the voice of Rotta the Hutt, Jabba's sonThe helmet is off, and the stakes have never been higher. Following a brief and divisive Super Bowl teaser, Lucasfilm has officially released the full theatrical trailer for The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu. Arriving just three months before the film’s May 22, 2026 premiere, the new footage delivers the cinematic spectacle fans have been waiting for. In a moment that has instantly set the internet ablaze, the trailer shows Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) unmasked and vulnerable, signaling that the bounty hunter’s rigid creed may finally be taking a backseat to the desperate fight to protect his apprentice.Unmasked and Under Siege While Din Djarin has removed his helmet before, the trailer suggests this film will feature Pedro Pascal’s face far more prominently than the series ever did. The footage captures a battered, unmasked Din Djarin facing down the Hutt Twins, forcing him to fight a giant worm-like creature in an underground arena with nothing but his wits. This gladiatorial sequence introduces a surprising new antagonist: Rotta the Hutt, the son of the infamous Jabba. Voiced by The Bear star Jeremy Allen White, Rotta appears as a muscular, agile threat—a far cry from the sluggish crime lords of the past.A Galactic Manhunt The trailer clarifies the film's central plot: Din and Grogu are no longer just drifting through the Outer Rim; they are working directly for the New Republic. They report to Colonel Ward, a hardened military leader played by sci-fi icon Sigourney Weaver. \"This isn't about revenge,\" she tells Mando, \"it's about preventing another war.\" This mission tasks the duo with hunting down Imperial warlords across the galaxy, leading to stunning set pieces including a snow planet battle featuring AT-AT walkers and a high-speed chase where Grogu pilots his own rocket-powered hover pram.Expanding the Universe Director Jon Favreau appears to be pulling from the deep lore of the Star Wars universe to bridge the gap between streaming and cinema. Eagle-eyed fans will spot the return of Zeb Orrelios (voiced by Steve Blum) from Star Wars Rebels, fighting alongside New Republic forces. With its mix of massive military action, creature features, and emotional character beats, the trailer aims to reassure audiences that The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will be a true theatrical event, marking the franchise's first return to the big screen since 2019.The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu opens in theaters worldwide on May 22, 2026. With the official trailer now racking up millions of views, anticipation is hitting a fever pitch for what promises to be the definitive chapter in Din Djarin and Grogu’s journey.&nbsp;Read more at Hypebeast",

        "title": "Inside the Week Before Football’s Biggest Game",
        "text": "This story is produced in partnership with Lexus and the all-electric Lexus RZ. As the dust settles after the Big Game, attention turns from the spectacle itself to the moments, ideas, and creativity that surrounded it. In that same spirit, the Lexus RZ represents a new generation of performance — one defined not just by power, but by intention, design, and the lasting impact it creates.Growing up in the Pacific Northwest, my football fandom was determined at birth. I’ve been a lifelong fan of Seattle. When I found out not only that I would be attending the world’s biggest football game, but that my team would be the favorite to win it, I was left speechless. It was my first time watching a professional game in person, and I can’t imagine I’ll experience anything like it again.While my excitement peaked when the football season culminated in the moment that every fan dreams of, the entire week leading up to it was special. Courtesy of Lexus USA, I was on a mission to attend as many activations, athlete appearances, and celebrations as possible. Now that the chaos has settled, here’s a look back at the week’s highlights.&nbsp;View this post on Instagram&nbsp;A post shared by HYPEBEAST (@hypebeast)Jordan Family HouseKicking off the week of excitement was the Jordan Family House. The Jumpman team took someone’s multi-floor home and flipped it into a special destination featuring everything from a content studio to a mini art gallery. The Air Jordan 6 archive room immediately caught my eye upon entering the space. Not only did it spotlight classic colorways and football PEs, but it also included Travis Scott-signed collab pairs, too. The cherry on top was a one-of-a-kind grail: the original genie shoe from a 1991 Spike Lee commercial for the AJ6. While in the space, I noticed Puka Nacua and Myles Garrett perusing the artwork dedicated to the brand’s athletes. My stop was completed with a visit to the Embargo Room, where I previewed Jordan Brand products I can’t talk about (yet).Meta HouseNext door to my hotel was another invite-only event: the Meta House. Walking down the steps, I entered a space filled with the latest wearable technology. I started with a trial of the Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses, which captured my lackluster spiral as I struggled to rack up points in the football toss. Thankfully, a trip to the snack bar let me forget all about my low score. From there, I finally got to try out glasses with an in-lens display for the first time. It took me a moment to get acquainted with it, but when everything clicked, it was like magic. Being able to look up items in front of me on the fly and have live captions for conversations was an eye-opening experience.adidas Brand HubFrom wearable tech, I shifted gears toward the waterfront. After taking in the picturesque scenery, I entered adidas’ friends-and-family-exclusive gathering. Over 20 unique football cleats were on display, ranging from the Anthony Edwards 1 Cleat to new collaborations with Hellstar and Y-3. One of the biggest stars of the week, Bad Bunny, had a room dedicated to his upcoming footwear and apparel with the Three Stripes. However, it was strictly a no-photography zone. As I continued through the space, grabbing a light bite, I took in the impressive view and noticed adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden standing next to me.eBay End ZoneJust a few blocks away, the energy shifted from brand showcase to collector culture at the eBay End Zone pop-up. When I first came by, a huge crowd had amassed to see Jerry Rice on stage. The San Francisco legend was one of several notable athletes to host livestreamed auctions. Christian McCaffrey and Rob Gronkowski also brought energy by making appearances. Other vendors had streams running on eBay Live, offering everything from trading cards to high-end watches. Before heading out, I made sure to grab myself a commemorative tee and check out the vintage shopping zone. From retro Starter jackets to Raf Simons x adidas kicks, the curation was on point.Nike Athlete House ft. Kyren WilliamsNike, of course, had its own statement to make. The brand converted Japanese-Peruvian restaurant Chotto Matte into an “Athlete House.” The sushi was out-of-this-world, but that wasn’t the only hospitality element. Unique football cleats were on display throughout the space, alongside a demo station for the Mind 001. The Swoosh even had a golf simulator installed on the sunny rooftop. After dusting off my swing, I made my way to the sunglasses zone. I forgot to pack a pair, so I was excited to learn that I could walk away with my model of choice. I was keen on grabbing another souvenir over at the customization corner, which featured artwork by local artist SKO Habibi. Amidst all of this action, I spotted Seattle icon Russell Wilson and Los Angeles powerhouse Kyren Williams, the latter of whom I spoke to briefly on the way out. Before we left, I asked him a few quick questions about the week and what it meant to be part of it.How are you enjoying the week so far?Kyren Williams: I feel good, man. Being here is an opportunity that not everybody gets. I wish I were playing this weekend, but to get involved is a blessing.We’re here with Nike. What does being connected to the Swoosh mean to you?I remember being a kid, going on the Nike site, and wishing that I could buy stuff. Now, I’m at the Nike Athlete House ahead of the biggest football game of the year, and it’s amazing. I’ve worked my whole life to get where I am, but to be connected with such a great company means everything to me.I see you have some Air Max 95s on today. What’s your favorite Nike silhouette?Foamposites. I had waited for a pair of Penny Hardaway’s shoes when I was younger. I didn’t end up getting them then, but that’s when my addiction began.What are you most looking forward to this week?Spending time with my family. I have my mom and sister out here. We’re going to the award show tonight, and we all get to walk the red carpet. Being able to share the experience with them is my favorite part of this.Marriott Bonvoy House Presented by VisaWith a packed week nearly complete, it was time for something strictly fun. The San Francisco Mint, a national historic landmark, was the venue for Marriott Bonvoy’s party. Vaults and bright ballrooms were converted into photo moments and dining rooms. In between snacking on the city’s popular cuisines, I grabbed a picture with Bijan Robinson and Jordan Mailata. The two later took the stage with Adam Devine for a Q&amp;A, preceding a performance by The All-American Rejects. Taking the stage with a lively rendition of “Dirty Little Secret,” it was as if I had been taken back in time to my childhood, when the rock band was on heavy rotation in my OG iTunes library.Deion Sanders at the Nike Smoke ShopClosing out the action, I pulled up to the Nike Smoke Shop hosted by Shoe Palace Union Square. The store had hopped into a time machine, transporting us back a few decades. Vintage kicks and airbrushed tees were accompanied by a ‘90s great himself, Deion Sanders. When he stepped up for his panel, the space lit up with excitement, especially the youth football crew that mobbed him at the entrance. While we watched Coach Prime unveil a variety of never-before-seen Nike PEs, we were also bestowed with wisdom from the one-of-a-kind athlete. Afterwards, I was ushered into a private room, where I was swiftly surrounded by cameras and people eager to get a word in with Coach. But for a few minutes, all the noise was blocked out, and it was just the two of us sitting side by side for an interview.How are you feeling?Deion Sanders: I’m excited, I’m happy, I’m elated. This was a phenomenal event. Hats off to everyone who put it together.You recently brought back your signature line with Nike. What has the experience of seeing your shoes be welcomed by the masses again been like for you?Nike has been full speed ahead in making sure we bring quality, not just quantity. And the fans, they sell them out like hot cakes, and I’m happy. Now, [with the shoes revealed today,] you’re starting to see more breakthroughs.I’m really excited about my son’s first shoe. We’re continuing the [Air DT Max ‘96] line with a low-top for him. Seeing your kid’s face on a shoe is a blessing. I don’t think there’s ever been a line where the father passed it on to the son. It’s wonderful.How do you hope people feel when they lace up your shoes?I want them to have that confidence, that faith, that je ne sais quoi. That thing that propels them to the next level, knowing they can do anything.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "title": "How Oakley’s Snow DNA Evolved Through Eras of Sport and Speed",
        "text": "What started in a California garage in 1975 has grown into over 50 years of shaping vision, performance, and sport. Since day one, Oakley's philosophy has remained simple: design for the future, deliver to the present. Guided by athlete-led insights from those who live in the elements, Oakley turns engineering into art. With hundreds of patented lens technologies—from High Definition Optics® (HDO®) to XYZ Optics® to Prizm™ Lens Technology—Oakley enables athletes to read terrain in any condition, backed by protection systems built for speed and impact. Oakley’s DNA in the snow runs deep, rooted in the knowledge that when athletes can see better, they can perform better. In celebration of The Winter Games and the brand's latest AURA collection, we look back—and ahead—at decades of rebellion, experimentation, and athlete-driven design. E Frame & L Frame In 1983, Oakley released its inaugural ski goggles: E frame & L frame. With a dual-lens design setting a new benchmark for clarity, protection, and performance on the mountain, Oakley’s first snow goggle established an innovative reputation for the brand. The lens, housed in an arc frame design, provides minimal distortion and maximum visibility. The L Frame was developed to offer all the benefits of the E Frame in a size that fits over prescription eyewear. Factory Lites & Eyeshades The Eyeshade System was built with the World Cup downhill in its DNA. Originally dubbed Factory Lites, the concept was deceptively simple: everything you wanted in a goggle and less – all the protection, all of the optics, and none of the bulk. There’s zero frame fighting your peripheral and no strap strangling your helmet. Crowbar  Reinventing the architecture of a snow goggle was no small task. The challenge: relieve pressure against the face without compromising optical clarity, visual acuity, or protection. The solution was Crowbar - a revolution in goggle design. Oakley engineered an outrigger system that relocated the stress points of the frame and strap to indirect anchor points outside the primary structure. The result was a goggle that floated against the face rather than gripping it. It was a new standard that reset the industry's understanding of how a goggles should be built. Flow Scape & Aura Collection Crafted for the present, Flow Scape delivers the biggest field of view Oakley has ever created. Introducing Vision Rapt Face Foam and the latest Switchlock™ Technology, it unlocks a 60% larger field of view than previous designs, setting a new benchmark in performance, fit, and clarity. Also debuting this year is the Aura Collection, apparel and eyewear created to honor the unseen forces that drive athletes, energy, intuition, resilience, and focus. Each piece reflects the pulse and spirit that propel athletes long before they reach the starting gate.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "Team Italy&#x27;s Michele Malfatti celebrates winning the gold medal in the final of the men&#x27;s team pursuit speedskating race at the 2026 Winter Olympics, in Milan, Italy, Tuesday, Feb. 17, 2026. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis)2026-02-17T16:53:17Z\n                                        CORTINA D’AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — The Italian men’s speedskating team is back on top in team’s pursuit.Davide Ghiotto, Andrea Giovannini and Michele Malfatti beat U.S. world record-holders Casey Dawson, Emery Lehman and Ethan Cepuran by 4 1/2 seconds to win the men’s team pursuit gold medal in speedskating on Tuesday at the Milan Cortina Olympics.Buoyed by raucous cheering from the home crowd at the Milano Speed Skating Stadium, the Italian men finished in 3 minutes, 39.20 seconds to give their country its first Olympic title in this event since the 2006 Turin Games.The United States started the final well and led for the early stages. But the Italians charged ahead over the closing laps, extending their advantage. When it ended, Ghiotto, Giovannini and Malfatti raised their arms and pumped their fists. On the opposite side of the track, silver medalists Dawson, Lehman and Cepuran leaned over, hands on knees.Canada collected its second consecutive Winter Games title in women’s team pursuit when Ivanie Blondin, Valerie Maltais and Isabelle Weidemann — the same athletes who won gold four years ago in Beijing — finished in 2:55.81, nearly a full second ahead of runner-up Netherlands.\n    \n        \n    \n\nSnow postpones women’s slopestyle snowboardingThe Olympic final for women’s snowboarding slopestyle was scrubbed off Tuesday’s schedule due to a heavy snowstorm in Livigno.The slopestyle final was scheduled to start at 1 p.m. local time, but organizers said it was called off. A new date for the final has not been announced.It delays New Zealander Zoi Sadowski-Synnott’s attempt at a repeat. She qualified first on Sunday — an opening round that was moved up a day because of the storms rolling in.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nLate surge lifts France to gold in biathlon relayFrance went from last place on the first leg to being first on the final lap to secure the country’s first Olympic gold medal in men’s biathlon  relay. World Cup champion Eric Perrot, skiing the final leg for France, missed two shots in his last standing shooting bout and was only seven seconds ahead of Norway’s Vetle Sjaastad Christiansen as they headed out to ski tracks packed with fresh snow. Perrot stayed ahead of Christiansen and took his team of Fabien Claude, Emilien Jacquelin and Quentin Fillon Maillet across the line first, in a time of one hour, 19 minutes and 55.2 seconds.Sweden was able to hang on for the bronze.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nNorway’s Oftebro earns second Nordic combined goldNorway’s Jens Luraas Oftebro won his second Nordic combined gold medal in a week, taking the large hill ski jump and 10-kilometer ski race. Johannes Lamparter of Austria earned his second silver in Italy and Ilkka Herola of Finland won bronze.The event begins with a single ski jump in the morning, where distance and style points are calculated to create a time advantage for the best jumper. The rest of the field starts the cross-country ski race behind the leader according to the ranking from their jump.Oftebro, who finished atop the podium in the normal hill competition event last week, started 22 seconds behind in fifth place. Herola started 32 seconds back in seventh place.\n    \n        \n    \n\nSupport and protest at Nordic combinedU.S. team skier Annika Malacinski attended the Nordic combined at the Milan Cortina Olympics on Tuesday to cheer for her younger brother Niklas. She came to protest, too.Nordic combined — ski jumping and cross-country in one — remains the only Winter Olympic sport that does not include women, even though women compete on the World Cup circuit and at world championships.“It’s heartbreaking, it really is,” Annika told The Associated Press while wrapped in a long pink and white coat, before taking her seat in the stands.___AP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

        "title": "Lidar Mobility Device Assists Navigation and Avoids Collisions",
        "text": "At CES 2026 in Las Vegas, Singapore-based startup Strutt introduced the EV1, a powered personal mobility device that uses lidar, cameras, and onboard computing for collision avoidance. Unlike manually-steered powered wheelchairs, the EV1 assists with navigation in both indoor and outdoor environments—stopping or rerouting itself before a collision can occur.Strutt describes its approach as “shared control,” in which the user sets direction and speed, while the device intervenes to avoid unsafe motion.“The problem isn’t always disability,” says Strutt cofounder and CEO Tony Hong. “Sometimes people are just tired. They have limited energy, and mobility shouldn’t consume it.”Building a mobility platform was not Hong’s original ambition. Trained in optics and sensor systems, he previously worked in aerospace and robotics. From 2016 to 2019, he led the development of lidar systems for drones at Shenzhen, China-based DJI, a leading manufacturer of consumer and professional drones. Hong then left DJI for a position as an assistant professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen—a school known for its research in robotics, human augmentation, sensors, and rehabilitation engineering.However, he says, demographic trends around him proved hard to ignore. Populations in Asia, Europe, and North America are aging rapidly. More people are living longer, with limited stamina, slower reaction times, or balance challenges. So, Hong says he left academia to develop technology that would help people facing mobility limitations.Not a Wheelchair—an EVEV1 combines two lidar units, two cameras, 10 time-of-flight depth sensors, and six ultrasonic sensors. Sensor data feeds into onboard computing that performs object detection and path planning.“We need accuracy at a few centimeters,” Hong says. “Otherwise, you’re hitting door frames.”Using the touchscreen interface, users can select a destination within the mapped environment. The onboard system calculates a safe route and guides the vehicle at a reduced speed of about 3 miles per hour. The rider can override the route instantly with joystick input. The system even supports voice commands, allowing the user to direct the EV1 to waypoints saved in its memory.The user can say, for example, “Go to the fridge,” and it will chart a course to the refrigerator and go there, avoiding obstacles along the way.  The Strutt EV1 puts both joystick controls and a lidar-view of the environment in front of the device’s user. StruttDriving EV1 in manual mode, the rider retains full control, with vibration feedback warning of nearby obstacles. In “copilot” mode, the vehicle prevents direct collisions by stopping before impact. In “copilot plus,” it can steer around obstacles while continuing in the intended direction of travel.“We don’t call it autonomous driving,” Hong says. “The user is always responsible and can take control instantly.”Hong says Strutt has also kept its users’ digital privacy in mind. All perception, planning, and control computations, he says, occur onboard the device. Sensor data is not transmitted unless the user chooses to upload logs for diagnostics. Camera and microphone activity is visibly indicated, and wireless communications are encrypted. Navigation and obstacle avoidance function without cloud connectivity.“We don’t think of this as a wheelchair,” Hong says. “We think of it as an everyday vehicle.”  Strutt promotes EV1’s use for both outdoor and indoor environments—offering high-precision sensing capabilities to navigate confined spaces. StruttTo ensure that the EV1 could withstand years of shuttling a user back and forth inside their home and around their neighborhood, the Strutt team subjected the mobility vehicle to two million roller cycles—mechanical simulation testing that allows engineers to estimate how well the motors, bearings, suspension, and frame will hold up over time. The EV1’s 600-watt-hour lithium iron phosphate battery provides 32 kilometers of range—enough for a full day of errands, indoor navigation, and neighborhood travel. A smaller 300-watt-hour version, designed to comply with airline lithium-battery limits, delivers 16 km. Charging from zero to 80 percent takes two hours.Might These EVs Be Covered by Insurance?The EV1 retails for US $7,500—a price that could place it outside the reach of people without deep pockets. For now, advanced sensors and embedded computing keep manufacturing cost high, while insurance reimbursement frameworks for AI-assisted mobility devices depend on where a person lives. “A retail price of $7,500 raises serious equity concerns,” says Erick Rocha, communications and development coordinator at the Los Angeles-based advocacy organization Disability Voices United,. “Many mobility device users in the United States rely on Medicaid,” the government insurance program for people with limited incomes. “Access must not be restricted to those who can afford to pay out of pocket.”Medicaid coverage for high-tech mobility devices varies widely by state, and some states have rules that create significant barriers to approval (especially for non-standard or more specialized equipment).Even in states that do cover mobility devices, similar types of hurdles often show up. Almost all states require prior approval for powered mobility devices, and the process can be time-consuming and documentation-heavy. Many states rigidly define what “medically necessary” means. They may require a detailed prescription describing the features of the mobility device and why the patient’s needs cannot be met with a simpler mobility aid such as a walker, cane, or standard manual wheelchair. Some states’ processes include a comprehensive in-person exam, documenting how the impairment described by the clinician limits activities of daily living such as toileting, dressing, bathing, or eating. Even if a person overcomes those hurdles, a state Medicaid program could deny coverage if a device doesn’t fit neatly into existing Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System billing codes“Sensor-assisted systems can improve safety,” Rocha says. “But the question is whether a device truly meets the lived, day-to-day realities of people with limited mobility.”Hong says that Strutt, founded in 2023, is betting that falling sensor prices and advances in embedded processing now make commercial deployment of the EV1 feasible.",

        "title": "Jack Carlson Is J. Press’s In-House Ivy Archaeologist",
        "text": "The New York Historical Society was a fitting stage for Jack Carlson’s sophomore J. Press collection. The designer, known for founding Rowing Blazers, also happens to hold a PhD in archaeology from Oxford University. It’s just one facet of Carlson’s stacked resume, which also includes former participation in the U.S. National Rowing Team.However, it's his university studies that inform his academic approach to fashion. Last season, his J. Press debut was hosted at The Explorers Club, a historic professional society founded in New York City in 1904. This season’s venue was built in 1804, making it the oldest museum in the entire city.J. Press itself is a living artifact of American history, established 123 years ago at Yale University, where the label laid the foundation for the sensibilities that would become known as “Ivy.” A lot like an ancient object unearthed from the ground, Carlson treats the brand with the same care and reverence that an archaeologist would an excavation. “It's sort of the last brand standing that embodies American Ivy style,” he explained.In addition to a designer’s typical fieldwork—from making distant fabric sourcing trips to unpacking crates of archival garments—reading and studying are at the core of his development process. This season, Carlson named Take Ivy, a Japanese title published in 1965, as his muse. One of the first books to distil Ivy League style in photographic detail, the book has become a cross-cultural historical document capturing the height of Ivy League style from a Japanese lens.In an in-depth conversation just a few weeks out from his NYFW presentation, Carlson expanded on J. Press’s notable presence in US history, the eternal value of craftsmanship, and why Ivy is not the same thing as prep.How are you feeling ahead of presenting your next J. Press collection at New York Fashion Week?I feel great. It's been a whirlwind first few months at J. Press, and I'm really enjoying it. I feel like I'm in the right place, and that's just a nice feeling to have. When I was at Rowing Blazers, we didn't really participate in the Fashion Week calendar. The only exception to that was the collaboration with Target, where we had an absolutely huge event. I could basically tap into Target’s huge team to manage all the details and pull it off. This is definitely very different. We have a great team, but it's just much smaller. I definitely have to be more involved in all the little details, but I enjoy that stuff.Could you talk about the inspiration behind the show?The theme of the show is an homage to the 1965 Japanese book, Take Ivy, which is now kind of a cult classic among menswear fans all over the world, but for a long time, was really underground outside of Japan.  What a lot of people might not realize, if they've just heard of Take Ivy, is that there's a whole section of the book about J. Press, and a lot of the clothes that the students in the book are wearing are J. Press.There's no brand that better encapsulates and symbolizes the relationship between American Ivy style and Japan than J. Press. It has a reasonably big footprint in Japan, and it’s been Japanese-owned since the mid-80s. I think it's one of the reasons that J. Press has remained as authentic as it is. We’re going to release a special edition of the book, Take Ivy, in conjunction with our runway show during New York Fashion Week.Not many fashion designers have a PhD in archaeology. How does that inform your approach?I think my background in archaeology and academia makes my process research-driven. It also predisposes me to want to do a lot with books, reading, and studying in general. In the first collection I did for J. Press last Fall/Winter, there was a literary component as well. We launched a book called The Pennant, which is a beautiful book about vintage college pennants.One of the first things I did when I started this role as Creative Director was to give the J. Press offices in Japan a huge list of vintage products to send me. It was crates and crates of stuff. A big thing I wanted to look at was all the vintage J. Press labels throughout the years and the labels we're using now. It’s a small thing that probably doesn't matter to 99% of people out there, but it's a recreation of the vintage J. Press labels that were being used at the time that Take Ivy came out in the '60s.Are there ways that these vintage silhouettes were updated for today, or did you really stay true to those references?It's a balancing act. J. Press has a very loyal customer base, and I would say that the loyal customer base is very rigorous about the fit, about maintaining the sort of authentic Ivy League structure and details. At the most basic level, the quintessential J. Press sport coat is a three-button, undarted, hook center vent jacket. You really don't want to mess with that too much. And you also don't want to come out with something that is going to look like it's cosplay, like you're playing someone in the Take Ivy book.A lot of our customers are the real deal, just as J. Press is the real deal. I think we have a responsibility to be the standard bearer for the American Ivy look today. We look at things like the fit or the length of the shorts, and let it inform what we’re doing without making a carbon copy.\"There's something about J. Press representing a kinder, gentler, softer, warmer, cozier, fuzzier vision of America. And I think there's a lot of nostalgia for that.\" — Jack CarlsonYour arrival at J. Press aligns with a period where prep and men's tailoring are seeing a revival. What do you think is driving people back to the classics at this moment?Regardless of what else is going on in the world, it always comes back around. I think a very long, rich, and fertile period for American preppy style began in '04 or '05 and went pretty strong until 2014 or so. And then it was really on the outs in terms of what the fashion world was looking at for a few years. I do agree there's something in the air. I think we're on the verge of yet another renaissance for this look and aesthetic.What I would say specifically about J. Press is that it is synonymous with Ivy League style—a vision of America that almost doesn't really exist anymore. J. Press dressed a lot of presidents and a lot of powerful people in the history of this country on both sides of the aisle, a lot of iconic people from all backgrounds and all walks of life. There's something about J. Press representing a kinder, gentler, softer, warmer, cozier, fuzzier vision of America. And I think there's a lot of nostalgia for that.Do you think that this wave we're currently experiencing is different from the way that it was, perhaps in the 2000s?I think it's a little more Ivy than it is preppy. In the early 2000s, up through that period, it was very colorful. It could even be kind of neon. It was harkening back to the Official Preppy Handbook era of the ‘80s: pink and green, really loud colors, popping your collar up, wearing multiple polo shirts at once.This is a different thing happening now, and I actually think J. Press and Ivy are much more central to what's happening—it's more dressed up, it's more classic. Back then, everything was slimmer and trimmer and so on. It's a whole different branch from preppy that I would call Ivy, which is actually older than prep. It's a little more grown-up, it's a little more sober. It can still be colorful, for sure, but it's more serious and academic.How has being at the helm of a heritage brand been different than leading your own label, Rowing Blazers?Whatever I do, it's gonna have my fingerprints and point of view, but ultimately, I view myself as the steward of a very important brand in American history. It's sort of the last brand standing that embodies American Ivy style. All of its peers in that genre have gone much more contemporary in their cuts, fits, and aesthetic because they’re chasing the market, rather than trying to stand for something.It's in no small part thanks to the stewardship of J.Press’s Japanese ownership and the continued involvement of the Press family. You could probably have more mass market appeal by changing some of the silhouettes or going more contemporary. You could start making J. Press polo shirts out of polyester, moisture-wicking whatever, but I would never do that. That's the opposite of what I would do, because to me, it's really about preserving the DNA.What do you value about doing things the “old-fashioned” way?How a button is sewn onto a shirt, how something is cut, or the fabric that you might use—you can actually do that anywhere in the world. China can do some of this, arguably more efficiently than anybody else. To me, the point isn't to do it as efficiently as possible. There's something about the DNA of J. Press. There's something about the magic of what makes it special—that it's actually made right here in New York City, or it's actually made on this remote island off the coast of Scotland, which is where our sweaters are made.What I value, and what I think a lot of customers value, is authenticity. That's like the most prized quality of any brand or any product or any piece of clothing, because it's a rarity. It's a word that's way overused, but it's the most valuable currency because it is so rare these days.\"What I value, and what I think a lot of customers value, is authenticity. That's like the most prized quality of any brand or any product or any piece of clothing, because it's a rarity.\" — Jack CarlsonWhat were some of your early encounters with J. Press, or are there any J. Press pieces that you've had for a really long time?I don't know what the very first thing I bought from J. Press was, but it was probably a tie. Many of my earliest ties, which I still have, come from J. Press. I have a navy blue tie with a duck motif, and a Madras tie. A lot of this was informed by my reading The Official Preppy Handbook, which my mom gave me her copy of when I was in eighth or ninth grade.J. Press is heavily featured in the Preppy Handbook as well, where it's described as something like \"the brand for those for whom Brooks Brothers is not traditional enough.\" And I kind of loved the idea of that, that it's like, this is like the final boss. At that time, especially, Brooks Brothers was in every mall, but for J. Press, you had to go to right next to Yale, Harvard, the White House, or the Yale Club in New York City.Are there particular J. Press pieces that you've been loving to wear right now?I’m wearing the Bulldog sweater, which has been sold out for a while, but we're restocking next month. Most days, I wear a tweed sport coat, a tie, and corduroy. It’s kind of like my go-to uniform. Or I wear a Shaggy Dog sweater—I would say the Shaggy Dog is probably my number one. There are a lot of knock-offs, but the level of brushing, colors, and fit that we have is just different.What are some books that you've been enjoying recently, or are there books that, aside from Take Ivy, informed the new collection?I have a pretty big library that I've accumulated of old Japanese magazines going back to Men's Club from the ‘70s and ‘80s, Free &amp; Easy from the early 2000s, and a lot of Japanese books. Those are actually my go-tos for inspiration. A lot of people know Take Ivy, but fewer people know that there are other books in that vein, almost like sequels to Take Ivy. One is just called The Ivy, and it’s basically the 1980s version of Take Ivy. And then the other one is called Take 8 Ivy, which has unseen photos from the original Take Ivy trip and later trips. Those have been great sources of inspo for this collection.As far as just what I'm reading, I'm in the middle of reading Graydon Carter's memoir right now, and I'm also just about to start a new book by David Marx, who wrote Status and Culture. He's just come out with a new book that’s a history of the 21st Century [Blank Space: A Cultural History of the 21st Century].Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "Summary Lauren Halsey partnered with Rapha and the Miami Design District to design a limited-edition jersey for the Dolphins Cancer Challenge Proceeds support cancer research at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer CenterEarlier this year, the Miami Design District unveiled its latest art-meets-performance collaboration, tapping Los Angeles–based artist Lauren Halsey to design a limited-edition Pro Team Training Jersey in partnership with Rapha. Created for the Miami Design District’s official cycling team participating in the Dolphins Cancer Challenge, the jersey debuted in January as part of “The Art of Giving Back,” a philanthropic initiative tied to the ride’s 16th edition.Since launching in 2010, the Dolphins Cancer Challenge has united tens of thousands of riders across Florida and beyond, raising nearly $100 million for cancer research at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, part of the University of Miami Health System. Proceeds from sales of Halsey’s jersey are supporting the center’s ongoing research efforts.Worn by members of the Miami Design District team during this year’s race, the jersey is also available for purchase in-store at Rapha Miami and online via DesignDistrict.com, extending the project’s impact beyond race day.Known for her immersive installations and deeply rooted civic engagement, Halsey translated her sculptural, socially conscious language into a wearable format for the first time. Drawing from the visual codes of South Central Los Angeles — signage, funk, geometry and layered architectural motifs — the design channels her distinct aesthetic into performance fabric built for movement. The result bridges contemporary art and technical sportswear without compromising either.“Lauren’s work challenges boundaries between art, architecture, and activism,” said Craig Robins, President and CEO of Dacra and a longtime collector of Halsey’s work. “To have her voice represented in the Dolphins Cancer Challenge through this jersey is both meaningful and momentous.”Halsey joins a roster of previous Miami Design District x DCC collaborators including Mario Ayala, Bisa Butler, Daniel Arsham, Urs Fischer and Harmony Korine, each of whom has brought a distinct creative edge to past editions of the ride. Following its January launch celebration at the Amiri store in the Miami Design District, the collaboration continues to carry visibility through the DCC’s “Ride With The Champs” activation this month, culminating on February 28 at Hard Rock Stadium for the 16th Dolphins Cancer Challenge.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",
