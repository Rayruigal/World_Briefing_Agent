(Iranian Foreign Ministry via AP)2026-02-17T05:00:30Z\n                                        GENEVA (AP) — The U.S. and Iran are expected to hold their second round of talks about Iran’s nuclear program Tuesday in Geneva as the United States ramps up its military presence in the Middle East and Iran holds large-scale maritime exercises.U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to use force to compel Iran to agree to constrain its nuclear program. Iran has said it would respond with an attack of its own. Trump has also threatened Iran over its deadly crackdown on recent nationwide protests.The first round of talks Feb. 6 were held in Oman, a sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, and were indirect, with SUVs flying the American flag entering the palace venue only after it appeared the Iranian officials had left. The arrangements for Tuesday’s round of negotiations were not clear.Trump’s envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner were traveling for the new round of talks. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, visiting Budapest, Hungary, said Monday that the U.S. hopes to achieve a deal with Iran, despite the difficulties. “I’m not going to prejudge these talks,” Rubio said. “The president always prefers peaceful outcomes and negotiated outcomes to things.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is leading the talks for Iran, met with the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency Monday in Geneva.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n“I am in Geneva with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal,” Araghchi wrote on X. “What is not on the table: submission before threats.” \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nLast week, a top Iranian security official traveled to Oman and met with Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, the chief intermediary in the talks, in a meeting likely focused on updates from the first round and next steps. “Regional peace and security is our priority, and we urge restraint and wise compromise,” al-Busaidi wrote on X after his meeting with Ali Larijani, a former Iranian parliament speaker who now serves as the secretary to the country’s Supreme National Security Council. Iran has in the past communicated its positions in writing when dealing with the Americans. Famously, Japan’s then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe tried to hand Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei a letter from Trump in 2019 that he refused to take.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIran holds naval drills against the US military buildupIran announced that its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard started a drill early Monday morning in the Strait of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, waterways that are crucial international trade routes through which 20% of the world’s oil passes.Separately, EOS Risk Group said sailors passing through the region received a radio warning that the northern lane of the Strait of Hormuz, in Iranian territorial waters, likely would see a live-fire drill Tuesday. Iranian state TV did not mention the live-fire drill.It was Iran’s second warning in recent weeks about a live-fire drill. Last week, Trump said the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, was being sent from the Caribbean Sea to the Mideast to join other warships and military assets the U.S. has built up in the region. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe Ford, whose new deployment was first reported by The New York Times, will join the USS Abraham Lincoln and its accompanying guided-missile destroyers, which have been in the region for over two weeks. U.S. forces already have shot down an Iranian drone that approached the Lincoln on the same day last week that Iran tried to stop a U.S.-flagged ship in the Strait of Hormuz.Gulf Arab nations have warned any attack could spiral into another regional conflict in a Mideast still reeling from the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIran says any deal must include easing of punishing sanctionsThe Trump administration is seeking a deal to limit Iran’s nuclear program and ensure it does not develop nuclear weapons. Iran says it is not pursuing weapons and has so far resisted demands that it halt uranium enrichment or hand over its supply of uranium. Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi signaled that Tehran could be open to compromise on the nuclear issue, but is looking for an easing of international sanctions led by the United States.“The ball is in America’s court. They have to prove they want to have a deal with us,” Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC on Sunday. “If we see a sincerity on their part, I am sure that we will be on a road to have an agreement.”“We are ready to discuss this and other issues related to our program provided that they are also ready to talk about the sanctions,” he added.The U.S. and Iran were in the middle of months of meetings when Israel’s launch of a 12-day war against Iran back in June instantly halted the talks. The U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites during that war, likely destroying many of the centrifuges that spun uranium to near weapons-grade purity. Israel’s attacks decimated Iran’s air defenses and targeted its ballistic missile arsenal as well. \n    \n        \n    \n\nIran has insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Before the June war, Iran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels.___Associated Press writer Melanie Lidman contributed from Tel Aviv, Israel.___The Associated Press receives support for nuclear security coverage from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and Outrider Foundation.

        "text": "Colin Gray, the father of Apalachee High School shooting suspect Colt Gray, looks down as his attorney gives his opening statement in the courtroom at the Barrow County courthouse, Monday, Feb. 16, 2026, in Winder, Ga. (Jason Getz/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP)2026-02-16T06:39:52Z\n                                        A man whose teenage son is accused of killing two students and two teachers at a Georgia high school should be held responsible for providing the weapon despite warnings about alleged threats his son made, a prosecutor said Monday.The trial of Colin Gray began Monday in one of several cases around the country where prosecutors are trying to hold parents responsible after their children are accused in fatal shootings. Gray faces 29 counts, including two counts of second-degree murder, two counts of involuntary manslaughter and numerous counts of second-degree cruelty to children related to the September 2024 shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder.“This is not a case about holding parents accountable for what their children do,” Barrow County District Attorney Brad Smith said in his opening statement. “This case is about this defendant and his actions in allowing a child that he has custody over access to a firearm and ammunition after being warned that that child was going to harm others.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nProsecutors argue that amounts to cruelty to children, and second-degree murder is defined in Georgia law as causing the death of a child by committing the crime of cruelty to children.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nInvestigators have said Colt Gray, who was 14 at the time, carefully planned the Sept. 4, 2024, shooting at the school northeast of Atlanta that is attended by 1,900 students.But Brian Hobbs, an attorney for Colin Gray, said the shooting’s planning and timing “were hidden by Colt Gray from his father. That’s the difference between tragedy and criminal liability. You cannot hold someone criminally responsible for failing to predict what was intentionally hidden from them.”\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nWith a semiautomatic rifle in his book bag, the barrel sticking out and wrapped in poster board, Colt Gray boarded the school bus, investigators said. He left his second-period class and emerged from a bathroom with the gun and then shot people in a classroom and hallways, they said.\n    \n        \n    \n\nSmith told the jury that Colin Gray’s daughter was in lockdown at her middle school and texted her father that there had been a shooting at the high school. When law enforcement arrived at Gray’s home, he met them in the garage and “without any prompting, he blurts out, ‘I knew it,’” Smith said.Smith said that in September 2021, Colt Gray used a school computer to search the phrase, “how to kill your dad.” School resource officers were then sent to the home, but it was determined to be a “misunderstanding,” Smith said.Sixteen months before the shooting, in May 2023, law enforcement acted on a tip from the FBI after a shooting threat was made online concerning an elementary school. The threat was traced to a computer at Gray’s home, Smith said.Colin Gray was told about the threat and was asked whether his son had access to guns. Gray replied that he and his son “take this school shooting stuff very seriously,” according to Smith. Colt Gray denied that he made the threat and said that his online account had been hacked, Smith said.That Christmas, Colin Gray gave his son the gun as a gift and continued to buy accessories after that, including “a lot of ammunition,” Smith said.\n    \n        \n    \n\nColin Gray knew his son was obsessed with school shooters, even having a shrine in his bedroom to Nikolas Cruz, the shooter in the 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, prosecutors have said. A Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent had testified that the teen’s parents had discussed their son’s fascination with school shooters but decided that it was in a joking context and not a serious issue.Three weeks before the shooting, Gray received a chilling text from his son: “Whenever something happens, just know the blood is on your hands,” according to Smith.Colin Gray was also aware his son’s mental health had deteriorated and had sought help from a counseling service weeks before the shooting, an investigator testified.“We have had a very difficult past couple of years and he needs help. Anger, anxiety, quick to be volatile. I don’t know what to do,” Colin Gray wrote about his son. \n    \n        \n    \n\nBut Smith said Colin Gray never followed through on concerns about getting his son admitted to an in-patient facility.The trial is being held in Winder, in Barrow County, where the shooting happened. The defense asked for a change of venue because of pretrial publicity, and prosecutors agreed. The judge kept the trial in Winder but decided to bring in jurors from nearby Hall County to hear the case. Jurors were selected last week.___Raby reported from Charleston, West Virginia.",

        "title": "Jaden Smith on Why I LOVE YOU Is the \"Most Authentic\" Part of His Artistry",
        "text": "At the beginning of my phone interview with Jaden Smith, I had to start by telling him his song “K” was one of my favorites ever. Unintentionally, it proved the perfect starting point for our conversation about his latest creative venture under I LOVE YOU, his non-profit, which he explains was deeply informed by his 2019 album ERYS. ​In support of his I LOVE YOU RESTAURANT – a food truck that serves free vegan meals to the Skid Row community – Jaden just dropped a limited line of I LOVE YOU graphic merch, with all proceeds going back to the nonprofit to fund I LOVE YOU's ability to provide free meals to the unhoused. He shared more insight on the design process of the merchandise, as well as on the growth and future goals of I LOVE YOU and how it ties into his larger creative universe.Could you say more about how EYRS prompted the launch of I LOVE YOU?When I was making the EYRS album, that’s when I was really confronted with what was going down on Skid Row. All of the music videos for that album were shot in downtown LA. I realized I can’t just come here and, like, use the backdrop that's been created, without giving back.Why was giving back to the people of Skid Row, in particular, so important to you?I have to go back a while for this one. This goes all the way back to when I was filming The Pursuit of Happyness, living in San Francisco with my dad. We hired homeless people to be extras in the film, and it's part of the reason why the movie feels so real. That also just really engraved the realities of Skid Row into my brain. Those early experiences on Skid Row, combined with the experience of EYRS, just made me have this feeling of wanting to actively give back.What was the goal in launching I LOVE YOU?The initial goal was to make a non-profit, catered to this generation, that was cool. I wanted it to have a design language and clear aesthetic, and have everything shot and styled really cool. This generation cares a lot, and they are really vocal about what they care about, so I wanted to speak to that. I’d been seeing so much negativity, and I wanted to put more positivity into the world. I knew people would cling to it positively, and I knew it would make people smile, which is what pushed me to do it even more.How did you decide on the name? Certain words and energy, scientifically, can have a certain effect on people and molecules. That’s why I decided to name it I LOVE YOU, because saying \"I love you\" has a positive effect on your brain. It’s forcing people to say “I love you” over and over again when they talk about it. You always hear it. You’re always saying it. You’re seeing it everywhere. It just affects your brain positivity.Walk me through the design process of the Valentine’s Day graphics?MSFTS [Smith's sustainable streetwear brand and creative collective] used to produce an I LOVE YOU shirt. It was just a shirt that said “I LOVE YOU,” and we used to give it out to all of our volunteers, but we ran out of those shirts because of all of the activations we were doing. I was designing for Christian Louboutin at the time, and I wanted to design more clothes, so I came up with these puff-printed hoodies and T-shirts for I LOVE YOU with the text “I’m not a volunteer, I’m just a person who believes in this.” I sat down with the design team at MSFTS, and we got to work.Why drop a merch collection?We only get our donations from big corporations that actually want to be involved. We’re for the people, and funded by the people, is what we say. This merch drop is my way to allow the people, and even those who haven’t been on the ground volunteering with us, to feel like they are part of the community. It’s more of a spiritual purpose. And that’s what I think fashion is about, an indication, from afar, of the kind of person you are.How does I LOVE YOU fit into your creative universe at large? It’s hard to get a sense of my personality. I make it hard to do so because that’s just how I am, but I LOVE YOU is what I would say is at the core of my personality and the most authentic reflection of the kind of person I am. In my music, I talk a lot about changing the world and speaking, and this next generation of existence, and I LOVE YOU carries over those themes too and represents that part of my artistry. MSFTS has always been rooted in the concept of the next generation coming together as one and giving back, and that’s the core sentiment of I LOVE YOU, so it also speaks to that part of my artistry as well. I LOVE YOU speaks to all of these different sides of who I am and the different sides of people in the world, so that when they see it on the internet, it resonates with them. Out of all of the things that I have done in my life, I LOVE YOU is one of them that resonates with people in the way that I really, really want it to.What’s in the potential pipeline for I LOVE YOU?One day, I’d love to have an I LOVE YOU gala that happens somewhere different around the world each year. My end goal is to have a matrix of nonprofits. I just want to create a world where everyone can go outside, celebrate, and change the world together.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "Actor Robert Duvall arrives for the screening of the film &quot;We Own the Night,&quot; at the 60th International film festival in Cannes, southern France, on May 25, 2007. (AP Photo/Lionel Cironneau, file)2026-02-16T18:50:27Z\n                                        LOS ANGELES (AP) — Robert Duvall, the Oscar-winning actor of matchless versatility and dedication whose classic roles included the intrepid consigliere of the first two “Godfather” movies and the over-the-hill country music singer in “Tender Mercies,” has died at age 95.Duvall died “peacefully” at his home Sunday in Middleburg, Virginia, according to an announcement from his publicist and from a statement posted on his Facebook page by his wife, Luciana Duvall. “To the world, he was an Academy Award-winning actor, a director, a storyteller. To me, he was simply everything,” Luciana Duvall wrote. “His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court. For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented.”The bald, wiry Duvall didn’t have leading man looks, but few “character actors” enjoyed such a long, rewarding and unpredictable career, in leading and supporting roles, from an itinerant preacher to Josef Stalin. Beginning with his 1962 film debut as Boo Radley, the reclusive neighbor in “To Kill a Mockingbird,” Duvall created a gallery of unforgettable portrayals. They earned him seven Academy Award nominations and the best actor prize for “Tender Mercies,” which came out in 1983. He also won four Golden Globes, including one for playing the philosophical cattle-drive boss in the 1989 miniseries “Lonesome Dove,” a role he often cited as his favorite.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIn 2005, Duvall was awarded a National Medal of Arts.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nHe had been acting for some 20 years when “The Godfather,” released in 1972, established him as one of the most in-demand performers of Hollywood. He had made a previous film, “The Rain People,” with Francis Coppola, and the director chose him to play Tom Hagen in the mafia epic that featured Al Pacino and Marlon Brando among others. Duvall was a master of subtlety as an Irishman among Italians, rarely at the center of a scene, but often listening and advising in the background, an irreplaceable thread through the saga of the Corleone crime family.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“Stars and Italians alike depend on his efficiency, his tidying up around their grand gestures, his being the perfect shortstop on a team of personality sluggers,” wrote the critic David Thomson. “Was there ever a role better designed for its actor than that of Tom Hagen in both parts of ‘The Godfather?’”\n    \n        \n    \n\nIn another Coppola film, “Apocalypse Now,” Duvall was wildly out front, the embodiment of deranged masculinity as Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, who with equal vigor enjoyed surfing and bombing raids on the Viet Cong. Duvall required few takes for one of the most famous passages in movie history, barked out on the battlefield by a bare-chested, cavalry-hatted Kilgore: “I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for 12 hours. When it was all over, I walked up. We didn’t find one of ‘em, not one stinkin’ dink body. “The smell, you know that gasoline smell, the whole hill. Smelled like — victory.”Coppola once commented about Duvall: “Actors click into character at different times — the first week, third week. Bobby’s hot after one or two takes.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nHonored, but still hungry He was Oscar-nominated as supporting actor for “The Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now,” but a dispute over money led him to turn down the third Godfather epic, a loss deeply felt by critics, fans and “Godfather” colleagues. Duvall would complain publicly about being offered less than his co-stars.Fellow actors marveled at Duvall’s studious research and planning, and his coiled energy. Michael Caine, who co-starred with him in the 2003 “Secondhand Lions,” once told The Associated Press: “Before a big scene, Bobby just sits there, absolutely quiet; you know when not to talk to him.” Anyone who disturbed him would suffer the well-known Duvall temper, famously on display during the filming of the John Wayne Western “True Grit,” when Duvall seethed at director Henry Hathaway’s advice to “tense up” before a scene.\n    \n        \n    \n\nDuvall was awarded an Oscar in 1984 for his leading role as the troubled singer and songwriter Mac Sledge in “Tender Mercies,” a prize he accepted while clad in a cowboy tuxedo with Western tie. In 1998, he was nominated for best actor in “The Apostle,” a drama about a wayward Southern evangelist which he wrote, directed, starred in, produced and largely financed. With customary thoroughness, he visited dozens of country churches and spent 12 years writing the script and trying to get it made.Among other notable roles: the outlaw gang leader who gets ambushed by John Wayne in “True Grit\"; Jesse James in “The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid\"; the pious and beleaguered Frank Burns in “M-A-S-H\"; the TV hatchet man in “Network\"; Dr. Watson in “The Seven-Per-Cent Solution\"; and the sadistic father in “The Great Santini.”\n    \n        \n    \n\n“When I was doing ‘Colors’ in 1988 with Sean Penn, someone asked me how I do it all these years, keep it fresh. Well, if you don’t overwork, have some hobbies, you can do it and stay hungry even if you’re not really hungry,” Duvall told The Associated Press in 1990.In his mid-80s, he received a supporting Oscar nomination as the title character of the 2014 release “The Judge,” in which he is accused of causing a death in a hit-and-run accident. More recent films included “Widows” and “12 Mighty Orphans.”Ungifted in school, gifted on stageRobert Selden Duvall grew up in the Navy towns of Annapolis and the San Diego area, where he was born in 1931. He spent time in other cities as his father, who rose to be an admiral, was assigned to various duties.The boy’s experience helped in his adult profession as he learned the nuances of regional speech and observed the psyche of military men, which he would portray in several films.Duvall reportedly used his Navy officer father as the basis for his portrayal of the explosive militarist in “The Great Santini,” based on the Pat Conroy novel. He commented in 2003: “My dad was a gentleman but a seether, a stern, blustery guy, and away a lot of the time.” Bobby took after his mother, an amateur actress, in playing a guitar and performing. He was a wrestler like his father and enjoyed besting kids older than himself.He lacked the concentration for schoolwork and nearly flunked out of Principia College in Elsah, Illinois. His despairing parents decided he needed something to keep him in college so he wouldn’t be drafted for the Korean War. “They recommended acting as an expedient thing to get through,” he recalled. “I’m glad they did.” He flourished in drama classes.“Way back when I was in college,” Duvall told the AP in 1990, “there was a wonderful man named Frank Parker, who had been a dancer in World War I. We did a full-length mime play and I played a Harlequin clown. I really liked that.“Then, I played an older guy in ‘All My Sons,’ and at one point I had this emotional moment, where this emotion was pouring out. Parker said at that moment he didn’t think acting can be carried any further than that. And this guy was a very critical guy. So I thought, at that moment at least, this is what I wanted to do.”After two years in the Army, he used the G.I. Bill to finance his studies at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York, hanging out with such other young hopefuls as Robert Morse, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman. After a one-night performance in “A View From the Bridge,” Duvall began getting offers for work in TV series, among them “The Naked City” and “The Defenders.”Between his high-paying jobs in major productions, Duvall devoted himself to directing personal projects: a documentary about a prairie family, “We’re Not the Jet Set”; a film about gypsies, “Angelo, My Love”; and “Assassination Tango,” in which he also starred.Duvall had been a tango dancer since seeing the musical “Tango Argentina” in the 1980s and visited in Argentina dozens of times to study the dance and the culture. The result was the 2003 release about a hit man with a passion for tango.His co-star was Luciana Pedraza, 42 years his junior, whom he married in 2005. Duvall’s three previous marriages — to Barbara Benjamin, Gail Youngs and Sharon Brophy — ended in divorce.—-Former Associated Press Hollywood correspondent Bob Thomas, who died in 2014, was the primary writer of this obituary",

        "text": "Name: WTAPS x New Balance 1300 \"Black\"Colorway: Black/White-Black CementSKU: U1300WTMSRP: $295 USDRelease Date: February 20, 2026Where to Buy: New BalanceWTAPS is bringing its tactical precision back to New Balance. In a shift toward darker, more controlled aesthetics, the Japanese streetwear stalwart has unveiled its latest collaboration: a reworked New Balance 1300. Eschewing the noise of trend-driven designs, this partnership focuses on restraint, delivering a heritage runner that feels sharper and more utilitarian than its predecessors.The design ethos is defined by balance and subtlety. Black leather overlays dominate the build, paired with breathable mesh sections that maintain the silhouette's structural integrity without feeling overworked. The iconic \"N\" logo on the side is rendered tonally, blending quietly into the upper rather than demanding attention. This stealthy approach allows the shape of the 1300—a longtime favorite of connoisseurs—to do the talking.The monochromatic theme is broken only where necessary. A clean white leather tab at the heel cuts through the blackout finish, stamped with WTAPS branding for a stark, deliberate contrast. Inside, co-branded insoles provide a hidden layer of detail.Underfoot, the ENCAP midsole is fully blacked out, maintaining the sleek profile. However, the outsole introduces a more rugged edge with deeper traction, leaning slightly more functional than typical lifestyle iterations. This shift feels intentional, aligning with WTAPS' military-inspired philosophy. The WTAPS x New Balance 1300 (U1300WT) is scheduled to release on February 20, 2026.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "SummaryJ. Cole has officially announced The Fall Off Tour in support of his seventh studio albumThe global trek kicks off in his home state of North Carolina on July 11, 2026, and concludes in Johannesburg, South Africa, on December 12General ticket sales begin Friday, February 20, 2026J. Cole is taking his swan song on the road. Following the massive release of his seventh—and widely rumored to be final—studio album, The Fall Off, the Dreamville head honcho has unveiled dates for a sprawling global tour. Spanning six months and over 50 cities, The Fall Off  Tour promises to be a career-spanning celebration, bringing the narrative arc of his double album to life in arenas across the globe.The tour is set to launch on familiar turf, kicking off on July 11 at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. From there, Cole will traverse North America with major stops including Madison Square Garden in New York, the United Center in Chicago, and the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. After wrapping the US leg with a hometown show in Fayetteville, the tour heads international in October, hitting European staples like Berlin’s Uber Arena and London’s O2 before moving to Australia and New Zealand. The run culminates in a historic finale on December 12 at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa.While no opening acts have been officially confirmed, speculation is rife regarding potential guests. The Fall Off, released earlier this month on February 6, features uncredited vocals from heavyweights such as Future, Burna Boy, Erykah Badu, and Tems. Fans are hopeful that these collaborators might make surprise appearances, particularly at major market stops. The album itself serves as the thematic backbone of the tour, designed as an auditory farewell that references Cole's entire journey in the industry. Tickets for the North American leg are currently in artist presale, with international presales beginning Wednesday, February 18.

        "title": "Advisry's FW26 Character of Choice? The Space Cowboy",
        "text": "Each Advisry collections is a character study. As Keith Herron continues to evolve his brand's boundless, California-meets-New York City creative universe, the designer reminds us that Advisry's storytelling just starts with the clothing being shown on the runway.For Herron's Fall/Winter 2026 showcase, dubbed \"Return of the Space Cowboy,\" he honed in on the comeback story of the rebellious individual, heavily informed by what he describes as his \"futuristic perspective of the past.\" Drawing design influence from the interior futurism of Jamiroquai and the landscapes of Cowboy Bebop, this Advisry season arrives as the most mature sartorial foray we've seen from Herron since launching the label in 2014, and making its New York Fashion Week runway debut back in September of 2021.It's been captivating to watch Herron grow his creative uniform with such grace and cohesion, establishing strong sartorial staples and foundational style codes, and continuing to level them up. Motifs like pearled-patterning and glove hands reliably appear somehow in each Advisry range, but how they appear always remains to be seen.Set in a Lower East Side restaurant, the show started with a tap dance performance, Jabowen Dixon circling the entirety of the runway set to original music by a close friend of the brand, Cisco Swank. Headwear held strong once again, structurally more complex than past silhouettes. Pearls, for the first time, came dipped in black, while camera bags and glove hands also expanded into new forms.Explore the full collection in the gallery above, and read the full interview with Keith Herron below.Let's start with the name of the collection; tell me more about \"Return of the Space Cowboy.\" It's a character study, and what I love about the name of the collection is that it inherently has this narrative built around it. When you hear the title, you're like, \"Return of the Space Cowboy,\" like, who is this person? Because he's a cowboy, that implies that he's a rebel, and since he's a \"space\" cowboy, he's a futuristic one. \"Return\" implies this distant or close past, and I love that is has this referential quality to it. It's a futuristic perspective on the past itself. That's what I wanted to embody, that specific spirit within the collection, and a lot of the individual characters in the show were embodying that.Where does The Return of the Space Cowboy fit in the larger Advisry creative universe?All of the collections begin with the same core language and the identity of the brand itself. We see a lot of the same motifs, a lot of the same tailoring, and a lot of the same silhouettes, but reimagined through new fabrications and a new level of aspiration and showmanship that you can come to expect from the brand now that a little bit of those codes have been more established.How have the brand's design motifs – the glove hands, the pearls, the headwear – evolved in this particular range? It's always about implementing the same tools but in new ways. The motifs just continue evolving. This time, for the first time, we did a Black Pearl, because not everyone sees themselves in white, so it was great to see it reimagined in a darker colorway. The gloves, which we've shown in so many ways now, have evolved into a new glove pocket. We have a flat glove. We have the glove that features a wash mark from the glove being removed. The camera bag is another motif we keep evolving. This season, we have a bunch of new camera bags. We have camera bags. We have camera totes. We have camera pockets.There was a lot of green in this collection. Could you tell me more about the color palette? I wanted it to feel natural. There's a lot of earth tones – a lot of browns, yellows, and greens.The show opened with a full tap dance number – why did you make this choice? I wanted the tap-dance at the beginning to literally feel like an opening credits or theme song sort of sequence.On that note, could you say more about this season's runway soundtrack? Cisco Swank, who live-scored the show last season, handled the mix, right?Yeah, so we had Cisco create an acoustic version of \"Space Cowboy,\" which was made for the people who would recognize it. I wanted the soundtrack to really introduce the audience to the world of the character.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "title": "Inside Lucid’s Atmospheric ‘Seven Suite’ Spectacle in Berlin",
        "text": "Last week, Californian brand Lucid took to Berlin’s International Film Festival to stage Seven Suite; a cinematic multisensory event stepping into the world of its new all-electric Gravity SUV. With genre-defying composer Uèle Lamore at the helm, the performance was positioned as an extension of the car’s innovative design, immersing creatives, tastemakers and automotive mavens into its theater of emotions.In the run-up to the event, Lamore began by delving into her personal repertoire, reshaping her upcoming album to capture the feeling of entering the Lucid Gravity. “It was something we talked about in depth,” she explained of the process. “We wanted to bring the idea of nature into organic music elements, something of which the brand tries to incorporate into the car.”Flowing from the rainy peaks to the snow-dusted mountains, the resulting music ensemble came together with a composition that straddles the worlds of traditional orchestra and heady electronic music. Lamore added, “I created seven different stages in a tableau that ultimately represent the different things about the world that I find beautiful. I hope it makes people feel good, too.”A vast circular arena with a monumental ceiling, the iconic Tempodrom music venue served as the backdrop for the symphony, adding the finishing touch to what Lucid called “a spatial sound experience.” Under the glow of a central globe, seven Gravity SUVs formed a perfect circle with their frunk (front trunk) open. Engineered with built-in seating, the compartments welcomed 14 acclaimed actors and directors – including Diane Kruger, Jannis Niewöhner, and Emilia Schüle – at the most intimate vantage point in the room, just meters from the performance close enough to feel every vibration.At the drinks reception, attendees joined the film icons to fill out the surrounding stalls. For a few moments, the Tempodrom went dark, then it came alive with atmospheric lights that were designed to match the crescendo of sounds by Lamore. This multisensory experience engulfed the audience who collectively enjoyed the symphony’s intense heights as well as its mellow notes in a similar way to the car’s cabin of sounds created with the 22-speaker Surreal Sound Pro with Dolby Atmos.As the showcase drew to a close, guests headed out to the after-party to take a closer look at the seven-seat supercar. Checking out the car in its Grand Touring trim, an overwhelming thought shared by the crowds was that the Lucid Gravity was not just something that is simply driven, but also felt. The showcase echoed that sentiment, with the car’s technology inspiring innovation in various forms of creativity, whether it’s replicating the journey through music or the smooth curves in art. Simply sit in the car, or its frunk seat, and take in the emotional experience of the Gravity.Stay tuned to hear the stories of the actors and filmmakers from the event in Hypebeast’s upcoming campaign.To begin your journey in the Lucid Gravity, book your test drive on Lucid’s website.Read more at Hypebeast",

        "text": "SummaryCarhartt WIP has launched its Spring/Summer 2026 Icons collection, focusing on enduring utility and cultural longevityClassic staples like the Michigan Coat and Double Knee Pant return in new shades of dusky turquoise, green, and mauveThe collection also features evolved silhouettes, including the nylon canvas Clapton Jacket and the boxy, oversized Women’s Clark JacketCarhartt WIP is proving once again that true icons don't change—they evolve. For the Spring/Summer 2026 season, the brand is revisiting its most culturally significant silhouettes, preserving the utilitarian DNA that defined them while injecting fresh energy through color and structural adaptation. The new campaign highlights how these pieces, from the Detroit Jacket to the Double Knee Pant, have transcended their manual labor origins to become permanent fixtures in the collective memory of style.The core of the collection remains anchored in the brand's \"solid forms.\" The Michigan Coat retains its signature four-pocket configuration, while the Detroit Jacket keeps its recognizable waist-length cut and zipped chest pocket. The Double Knee Pant also stays true to spec with its double-layer knees and hammer loop. However, for SS26, these staples move beyond the traditional Hamilton Brown, black, and navy (though those core shades remain), appearing in new seasonal hues of dusky turquoise, green, and mauve.Beyond the color updates, Carhartt WIP is using its archive as a launchpad for new design explorations. The Women’s Maeve Skirt reinterprets the Double Knee Pant through paneling and metal rivets, offering a rugged yet contemporary alternative. The Clapton Jacket riffs on the Michigan Coat but swaps the canvas for nylon and adds a sleeve pocket for a modern utility look. Additionally, the Women’s Clark Jacket presents a subtly oversized take on the Detroit Jacket, synthesizing the boxy workwear original with current trend fits.The Carhartt WIP Spring/Summer 2026 Icons collection is available now and can find the release at select global retailers, Carhartt WIP flagship stores, the brand's official website.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "SummaryPalace Skateboards is set to release Drop 3 of its Spring 2026 collection, headlined by the Realtree Reversible Jacket and matching corduroy headwearGraphic highlights include the Edge Lamb T-shirt and the self-referential Me Myself and Tri T-shirtSeasonal layering options include the Patchy Flannel Shirt, Viola Knit, and a full Sporty Zip tracksuitFor the third week of the Spring 2026 season, Palace Skateboards is heading into the woods before skating back to the city. The latest drop offers a distinct mix of rugged, outdoor-inspired utility and the brand's signature irreverent graphic language. Leading the charge is a heavy dosage of camouflage, specifically the official Realtree pattern, applied to versatile outerwear and accessories, sitting alongside a cozy lineup of knits and sweats designed for the transitional weather.The standout piece for Drop 3 is undoubtedly the Realtree Reversible Jacket. This functional outerwear piece offers two distinct looks in one, allowing wearers to switch between a bold camo statement and a more subdued reverse side. It is accompanied by the Corduroy Realtree 6-Panel, a texture-rich hat that completes the hunter-chic aesthetic. For those preferring grunge over gore-tex, the Patchy Flannel Shirt offers a deconstructed take on the classic button-down, while the Viola Knit adds a layer of sophisticated texture to the lineup.No Palace drop is complete without a fresh rotation of graphic tees. This week features the Edge Lamb T-shirt, showcasing the brand's penchant for oddball animal imagery and the Me Myself and Tri T-shirt, a clever wordplay on the iconic Tri-Ferg logo.

        "text": "SummaryLogan Paul's rare \"Pikachu Illustrator\" card has sold for $16.49 million USD at Goldin AuctionsThe card is the only known copy in existence graded PSA Gem Mint 10 and the sale sets a new world record for the most expensive trading card ever sold at auctionThe winning bidder, identified as A.J. Scaramucci, received the card personally from Paul, along with a custom diamond-encrusted pendantThe \"Holy Grail\" of Pokémon cards has officially ascended to new heights. Logan Paul's famed Pikachu Illustrator card sold for a staggering $16,492,000 USD early Monday morning, obliterating previous records to become the most expensive trading card ever sold at auction. The sale, hosted by Goldin Auctions, saw the pristine PSA 10 card fetch more than three times what the WWE superstar originally paid for it in 2021, cementing its status as the ultimate collectible asset.The Pikachu Illustrator is widely considered the rarest Pokémon card in the world. Originally released in 1998 as a prize for an illustration contest by CoroCoro Comic, only 39 copies were officially distributed. Paul’s specific copy is unique even among that exclusive group: it is the only one in the world to receive a perfect Gem Mint 10 grading from PSA. The card features artwork by Atsuko Nishida, the original designer of Pikachu, and is distinct for its unique \"Illustrator\" header and pen icon.Logan Paul purchased the card in a private sale in 2021 for $5.275 million USD — a Guinness World Record at the time. He famously turned the collectible into a pop-culture moment by wearing it on a custom diamond chain to his WWE debut at WrestleMania 38. That same chain, valued at approximately $80,000 uSD, was included in the auction lot.The auction concluded after a fierce bidding war, with the final price reaching $13.3 million USD before the buyer's premium brought the total to nearly $16.5 million USD. Reports identified the winning bidder as A.J. Scaramucci, son of financier Anthony Scaramucci, who was present to receive the card directly from Paul in a publicized handover. According to the Guinness World Records which had a representative at the livestream Paul hosted alongside Goldin for the sale, this card now holds \"a new record title not only for the most expensive Pokémon card ever sold at auction but also the overall record for the most expensive trading card ever sold at auction.\"This sale redefines the ceiling for the trading card market, surpassing the previous auction record held by a 1952 Mickey Mantle card. It marks a massive return on investment for Paul and highlights the continued explosion of high-end alternative assets.Logan Paul's Pikachu Illustrator has OFFICIALLY sold for $16,492,000\"A new record title not only for the most expensive Pokemon card ever sold at auction but also the overall record for the most expensive trading card EVER sold at auction\" pic.twitter.com/uxLFqp0irQ— Jack (@Jackkk) February 16, 2026Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "This combo from images provided by the FBI shows surveillance footage at the home of Nancy Guthrie the night she went missing in Tucson, Ariz. (FBI via AP)2026-02-16T19:17:37Z\n                                        Investigators working on the disappearance of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie’s mother are consulting with Walmart management to develop leads because a backpack the suspect was wearing is sold exclusively at the stores, the Pima County, Arizona, sheriff said Monday.Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen at her Arizona home on Jan. 31 and was reported missing the following day. Authorities say her blood was found on the front porch. Purported ransom notes were sent to news outlets, but two deadlines for paying have passed.The Federal Bureau of Investigation released surveillance videos of a masked person wearing a handgun holster outside Guthrie’s front door in Tucson the night she vanished. A porch camera recorded video of a person with a backpack who was wearing a ski mask, long pants, a jacket and gloves. Pima Count Sheriff Chris Nanos said in a text message to The Associated Press on Monday that the 25-liter “Ozark Trail Hiker Pack” backpack was the only clothing item that has been “definitively identified.”\n    \n        \n    \n\n“This backpack is exclusive to Walmart and we are working with Walmart management to develop further leads,” Nanos said.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe suspect’s clothing “may have been purchased from Walmart but is not exclusively available at Walmart,” the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement Monday. “This remains a possibility only.”Investigators on Sunday announced that a glove discovered near the Guthrie home has been sent for DNA testing. The FBI said that it received preliminary results Saturday and was awaiting official confirmation. The development comes as law enforcement gathers more potential evidence and as the search for Guthrie’s mother heads into its third week.

Authorities have expressed concern about Nancy Guthrie’s health because she needs vital daily medicine. She is said to have a pacemaker and have dealt with high blood pressure and heart issues, according to sheriff’s dispatcher audio on broadcastify.com.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                SCOTT BAUER\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Bauer is the AP’s Statehouse reporter covering politics and state government in Madison, Wisconsin.

        "title": "Prosecutors plan to charge an Israeli settler with killing a Palestinian activist in the West Bank",
        "text": "Mourners carry the body of Palestinian activist Awdah Hathaleen during his funeral in the West Bank Bedouin village of Umm al-Khair, Aug. 7, 2025. (AP Photo/Mahmoud Illean, file)2026-02-16T17:20:07Z\n                                        RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — Israeli prosecutors said Monday that they plan to charge a settler in the killing of a Palestinian activist during a confrontation that was caught on video, opening a rare prosecution of violence by Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank.Attacks from settlers and home demolitions by authorities have spiked dramatically over the past two years, but the death in July of Awdah Hathaleen has drawn particular attention due to his involvement in the 2025 Oscar-winning film “No Other Land,” which chronicled Palestinian villagers’ fight to stay on their land. The case also stands out because the confrontation between Palestinians and Yinon Levi, an internationally sanctioned settler, was captured on video from multiple vantage points.In a video that family members say was taken by Hathaleen himself, Levi could be seen firing toward the person holding the camera. Another showed Levi firing two shots without showing where the bullets struck.\n    \n        \n    \n\nAn Israeli judge released Levi from custody six months ago, citing a lack of evidence that he fired the shots that killed Hathaleen.\n\nIsrael’s State Attorney General’s office confirmed in a statement Monday that it had initiated proceedings to indict Levi. It did not specify the charges.Eitan Peleg, an attorney for Hathaleen’s family, said the office had informed them it planned to indict Levi for reckless homicide, triggering a process that allows Levi to contest charges before they’re formally filed. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“Enforcement of the law in cases like this involving Palestinians in the West Bank is very rare, so this is unique,” Peleg told The Associated Press on Monday.Israel’s military referred questions on the indictment to police, who have not yet responded. Both bodies enforce laws in the area.More than 3.4 million Palestinians and 700,000 Israelis live in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories captured by Israel in 1967 and sought by Palestinians for a future state. The international community overwhelmingly considers Israeli settlement construction in these areas to be illegal and an obstacle to peace.\n    \n        \n    \n\nPalestinians and rights groups say authorities routinely fail to prosecute settlers or hold them accountable for violence. Under National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, investigations into settler attacks have plummeted, according to the Israeli rights group Yesh Din.Khalil Hathaleen, Awdah’s brother, said the family was glad some measure of justice was being pursued but felt the charge of “reckless homicide” was insufficient. “It was an intentional killing in broad daylight, with prior intent and premeditation,” he said.Levi’s attorney, Avichai Hajbi, declined Monday to comment on the coming indictment, which he said he hadn’t received. After the shooting, he told The Associated Press that Levi acted in self-defense, without elaborating. Levi did not answer phone calls Monday.\n    \n        \n    \n\nParts of the confrontation were filmedVideo released last year by B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights group showed Levi firing a gun toward the person filming. At the moment that B’Tselem says Hathaleen collapsed, the visuals are jostled but moans of pain can be heard. The group said it obtained the video from the family of Hathaleen, who said he filmed it.Additional footage obtained by the AP last year showed Levi waving a pistol during the standoff in Umm al-Khair that was with a group of Palestinians over an excavator that had rolled down from a nearby settlement and damaged Palestinian property earlier in the day.Alaa Hathaleen, a cousin who filmed the encounter, told AP at the time that he had approached Levi to tell him the group was unarmed and to stop the bulldozing. In the video, one Palestinian insults Levi and another challenges him to shoot. Levi shoves someone just out of the frame, demands to know who threw stones, and later fires a shot, seemingly away from the crowd. He then fires again and yells toward the crowd to get away from the excavator.The footage did not show where bullets struck, though other relatives said they saw Awdah Hathaleen fall immediately after shots were fired.\n    \n        \n    \n\nLevi was detained before being released to house arrest. That condition was eventually lifted, too. Levi was among the Israeli settlers sanctioned by the United States and other Western countries over allegations of violence toward Palestinians in 2024. President Donald Trump lifted the U.S. sanctions after taking office the following year.Attacks spike as spotlight growsActivists and crew members on the film “No Other Land” have said settler attacks have intensified on the village portrayed since the movie won the Oscar.Hamdan Ballal, one of the film’s directors, said his family home in Umm al-Khair was subject to another attack on Sunday. Four relatives were arrested during the confrontation, he said.Ballal said a soldier, who came to their home accompanied by another soldier and a settler-herder, grabbed his brother by the neck and tried to choke him. Neither the army nor the police responded to requests for comment on the incident.“The year after I won the Oscar, the assaults increased significantly. On a daily basis, settlers come and destroy the fields, destroy the trees, destroy the crops around the house,” he said.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIsraeli proof-of-ownership rules spark angerAs prosecutors move to indict Levi and violence persists across the West Bank, Israel is moving ahead with measures to deepen its control over land in the occupied territory.On Sunday, it announced it would resume a land registration process across the West Bank to require anyone with a claim to land to submit documents proving ownership. Rights groups say the process could strip Palestinians of land they’ve lived on and farmed for generations and transfer vast swaths of land to Israeli state control.Israel’s Foreign Ministry said the steps countered Palestinian Authority land registration efforts in areas where Israel maintains civil and military control.The measures follow years of accusations by Palestinians that actions by settlers and the military — campaigns of violence, harassment and demolitions — have pushed them from their land.The decisions have drawn widespread condemnation as violations of international law, including from countries involved in the ceasefire process in the Gaza Strip and Trump’s Board of Peace.Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry in a statement on Monday said the measures were part of Israel’s effort to impose a “new legal and administrative reality” that undermines prospects for peace and stability. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry called the move a “flagrant violation” of international law, warning it would escalate tensions in the Palestinian territories and across the region.___ Associated Press writer Melanie Lidman contributed reporting from Tel Aviv.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                SAM METZ\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Metz covers Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and points beyond for The Associated Press.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto",

        "text": "2026-02-16T17:41:46Z\n                                        ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — About 100 U.S. troops plus equipment have arrived in Nigeria to help train soldiers in the West African country as the government fights against Islamic militants and other armed groups, the Nigerian military announced Monday. The arrival followed a request by the Nigerian government to the U.S government for help with training, technical support and intelligence-sharing, the military said in a statement.The deployment follows an easing of tensions that flared between the U.S. and Nigeria when U.S. President Donald Trump said the country wasn’t protecting Christians from an alleged genocide. The Nigerian government has rejected the accusation, and analysts say it simplifies a very complicated situation in which people are often targeted regardless of their faith. Maj. Gen. Samaila Uba, spokesman for Nigeria’s Defense Headquarters, previously has said that the U.S. troops won’t engage in combat or have a direct operational role, and that Nigerian forces will have complete command authority.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIn December, U.S. forces launched airstrikes on Islamic State group-affiliated militants in northwestern Nigeria. Last month, following discussions with Nigerian authorities in Abuja, the head of U.S. Africa Command confirmed a small team of U.S. military officers were in Nigeria, focused on intelligence support.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nNigeria is facing a protracted fight with dozens of local armed groups increasingly battling for turf, including Islamic sects like the homegrown Boko Haram and its breakaway faction Islamic State West Africa Province. There is also the IS-linked Lakurawa, as well as other “bandit” groups that specialize in kidnapping for ransom and illegal mining.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nRecently, the crisis has worsened to include other militants from the neighboring Sahel region, including the Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin, which claimed its first attack on Nigerian soil last year. Several thousand people in Nigeria have been killed, according to data from the United Nations. Analysts say not enough is being done by the government to protect its citizens.While Christians have been among those targeted, analysts and residents say the majority of victims of the armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria’s Muslim-dominated north, where most attacks occur.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n                    \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n                    \n    获取更多RSS：https://feedx.net https://feedx.site",

Also on Day 10 of the Winter Games, the United States won its women’s hockey semifinal game. Canada plays next, which could set up yet another gold-medal decider between the old rivals. McGrath’s moment alone in the forestThe men’s slalom race had a finish like no other. Norway’s Atle Lie McGrath was leading the race and skiing last on the second run but straddled a gate and was out. He stopped, threw his ski poles over a fence and then started walking through deep snow to the forest for some time alone.The dramatic finish overshadowed Loic Meillard of Switzerland winning gold, and an earlier fall for giant slalom winner and South American history maker Lucas Pinheiro Braathen.It’s been an especially tough Olympics for McGrath, whose grandfather died on the day of the opening ceremony. McGrath was racing with an armband as a tribute.\n    \n        \n    \n\nEileen Gu’s quest in big airThe freestyle star who skis for China is going for her second medal of these Olympics as she aims to win the big air event for the second Games in a row.Gu was second in qualifying and will be up against Mathilde Gremaud, who beat her to the gold medal in slopestyle. Gu is also competing in the halfpipe later in the Milan Cortina Games.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nHockey semifinalsThe United States is into the women’s gold medal game after routing Sweden 5-0 as goaltender Aerin Frankel preserved a shutout streak which now stands at 331 minutes.

        "title": "California braces for a major winter storm expected to bring heavy rain and snow",
        "text": "South Lake Tahoe resident and international fruit importer Meg Dowley skis Palisades at Kirkwood Ski Resort in Kirkwood, Calif., on Saturday, Jan. 3, 2026. (Brontë Wittpenn/San Francisco Chronicle via AP, File)2026-02-16T15:53:46Z\n                                        Much of California on Monday was preparing to be hit by a powerful winter storm carrying treacherous thunderstorms, high winds and heavy snow in mountain areas. Jacob Spender, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Sacramento, urged people to take precautions in the coming days, advising them to pack winter safety kits, especially if they plan to travel as winter storm warnings were in place from southwest Oregon to the Southern California border. Forecasters said the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, northern Shasta County — including portions of Interstate 5 — and parts of the state’s Coast Range could see up to 8 feet (2.4 meters) of snow before the storm moves through late Wednesday.The heavy snow, wind and low visibility could also make travel conditions dangerous to near impossible, forecasters added. As of Monday, drivers navigating the Sierra Nevada were warned chains were required on vehicles to make it through snowy roads.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“It has seemed ‘spring-like’ for a large part of 2026, but winter is set to show it’s not quite done yet,” the Shasta County Sheriff’s Office said in a social media post urging residents to stay aware of the storm.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nPacific Gas &amp; Electric said in a news release that it was using artificial intelligence and machine-learning enhanced weather models to help determine where to send crews and equipment like power poles and transformers ahead of the storm. The utility company stressed that, unlike most winter storms, the anticipated weather event will “progress in several phases,” with multiple storm systems moving through the region that will likely intensify the risks from wind, rain and snow.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nMeanwhile, California’s Office of Emergency Services said it is placing fire and rescue personnel and resources in areas most at risk for flooding, mud and debris flows. Other states on Monday were bracing for different threatening weather events. Residents in parts of eastern Colorado received warnings Monday that they could be in fire danger due to a combination of abnormally high temperatures, gusty winds and dry conditions. The risks are expected to continue further into the week as gusts up to 60 mph (96 kph) are likely to hit the Colorado eastern plains on Tuesday. Parts of Texas, New Mexico, and Kansas were also under red flag warnings.\n    \n        \n    \n\nBack in California, rain had already begun Sunday in the San Francisco Bay Area, sparking officials to warn of potential flood risks. In coastal Santa Barbara County, a large eucalyptus tree fell across the 101 freeway, shutting the southbound side of the road to traffic, the county fire department said.To the south, Los Angeles area residents in some neighborhoods scarred by last year’s devastating wildfires were under an evacuation warning through Tuesday because of the potential for mud and debris flows. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she’s ordered emergency crews and city departments to be ready to respond to any problem.Kashawna McInerny, a realtor in the mountain town community of Wrightwood about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles, spent Monday trenching a part of their side yard to direct stormwater down the street and away from their home and neighbors.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThey placed a barrier made of metal and wood by a door outside her home to hopefully keep mud and debris from overtaking their laundry room again.McInerny, who’s lived in Wrightwood most of her life, said she still has several tons of rock and debris on her property from the Christmas and New Year storms that pummeled her community.“We’re not panicking yet. At least I’m not,” she said with a laugh.___Associated Press writers Amy Taxin from Santa Ana, Calif and Dorany Pineda in Los Angeles contributed to this report.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n                    \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n                    \n    获取更多RSS：https://feedx.net https://feedx.site",

Walk into any major museum, from Copenhagen to California, and you see glass cases filled with what could be called orphaned artifacts: remarkable objects, often acquired in the 19th and early 20th century, that have been completely stripped of their histories. You can see what they are—a mummy's painted foot case, a golden mask—but we have no idea where they came from. They are beautiful, but historically they are mute.",

        "title": "This Former Physicist Helps Keep the Internet Secure",
        "text": "When Alan DeKok began a side project in network security, he didn’t expect to start a 27-year career. In fact, he didn’t initially set out to work in computing at all.DeKok studied nuclear physics before making the switch to a part of network computing that is foundational but—like nuclear physics—largely invisible to those not directly involved in the field. Eventually, a project he started as a hobby became a full-time job: maintaining one of the primary systems that helps keep the internet secure.Alan DeKokEmployerInkBridge NetworksOccupationCEOEducation Bachelor’s degree in physics, Carleton University; master’s degree in physics, Carleton UniversityToday, he leads the FreeRADIUS Project, which he cofounded in the late 1990s to develop what is now the most widely used Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) software. FreeRADIUS is an open-source server that provides back-end authentication for most major internet service providers. It’s used by global financial institutions, Wi-Fi services like Eduroam, and Fortune 50 companies. DeKok is also CEO of InkBridge Networks, which maintains the server and provides support for the companies that use it.Reflecting on nearly three decades of experience leading FreeRADIUS, DeKok says he became an expert in remote authentication “almost by accident,” and the key to his career has largely been luck. “I really believe that it’s preparing yourself for luck, being open to it, and having the skills to capitalize on it.”From Farming to PhysicsDeKok grew up on a farm outside of Ottawa growing strawberries and raspberries. “Sitting on a tractor in the heat is not particularly interesting,” says DeKok, who was more interested in working with 8-bit computers than crops. As a student at Carleton University, in Ottawa, he found his way to physics because he was interested in math but preferred the practicality of science.While pursuing a master’s degree in physics, also at Carleton, he worked on a water-purification system for the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, an underground observatory then being built at the bottom of a nickel mine. He would wake up at 4:30 in the morning to drive up to the site, descend 2 kilometers, then enter one of the world’s deepest clean-room facilities to work on the project. The system managed to achieve one atom of impurity per cubic meter of water, “which is pretty insane,” DeKok says.But after his master’s degree, DeKok decided to take a different route. Although he found nuclear physics interesting, he says he didn’t see it as his life’s work. Meanwhile, the Ph.D. students he knew were “fanatical about physics.” He had kept up his computing skills through his education, which involved plenty of programming, and decided to look for jobs at computing companies. “I was out of physics. That was it.”Still, physics taught him valuable lessons. For one, “You have to understand the big picture,” DeKok says. “The ability to tell the big-picture story in standards, for example, is extremely important.” This skill helps DeKok explain to standards bodies how a protocol acts as one link in the entire chain of events that needs to occur when a user wants to access the internet.He also learned that “methods are more important than knowledge.” It’s easy to look up information, but physics taught DeKok how to break down a problem into manageable pieces to come up with a solution. “When I was eventually working in the industry, the techniques that came naturally to me, coming out of physics, didn’t seem to be taught as well to the people I knew in engineering,” he says. “I could catch up very quickly.”Founding FreeRADIUSIn 1996, DeKok was hired as a software developer at a company called Gandalf, which made equipment for ISDN, a precursor to broadband that enabled digital transmission of data over telephone lines. Gandalf went under about a year later, and he joined CryptoCard, a company providing hardware devices for two-factor authentication.While at CryptoCard, DeKok began spending more time working with a RADIUS server. When users want to connect to a network, RADIUS acts as a gatekeeper and verifies their identity and password, determines what they can access, and tracks sessions. DeKok moved on to a new company in 1999, but he didn’t want to lose the networking skills he had developed. No other open-source RADIUS servers were being actively developed at the time, and he saw a gap in the market.The same year, he started FreeRADIUS in his free time and it “gradually took over my life,” DeKok says. He continued to work on the open-source software as a hobby for several years while bouncing around companies in California and France. “Almost by accident, I became one of the more senior people in the space. Then I doubled down on that and started the business.” He founded NetworkRADIUS (now called InkBridge Networks) in 2008.By that point, FreeRADIUS was already being used by 100 million people daily. The company now employs experts in Canada, France, and the United Kingdom who work together to support FreeRADIUS. “I’d say at least half of the people in the world get on the internet by being authenticated through my software,” DeKok estimates. He attributes that growth largely to the software being open source. Initially a way to enter the market with little funding, going open source has allowed FreeRADIUS to compete with bigger companies as an industry-leading product.Although the software is critical for maintaining secure networks, most people aren’t aware of it because it works behind the scenes. DeKok is often met with surprise that it’s still in use. He compares RADIUS to a building foundation: “You need it, but you never think about it until there’s a crack in it.”27 Years of FixesOver the years, DeKok has maintained FreeRADIUS by continually making small fixes. Like using a ratcheting tool to make a change inch by inch, “you shouldn’t underestimate that ratchet effect of tiny little fixes that add up over time,” he says.He’s seen the project through minor patches and more significant fixes, like when researchers exposed a widespread vulnerability DeKok had been trying to fix since 1998. He also watched a would-be successor to the network protocol, Diameter, rise and fall in popularity in the 2000s and 2010s. (Diameter gained traction in mobile applications but has gradually been phased out in the shift to 5G.) Though Diameter offers improvements, RADIUS is far simpler and already widely implemented, giving it an edge, DeKok explains.And he remains confident about its future. “People ask me, ‘What’s next for RADIUS?’ I don’t see it dying.” Estimating that billions of dollars of equipment run RADIUS, he says, “It’s never going to go away.”About his own career, DeKok says he plans to keep working on FreeRADIUS, exploring new markets and products. “I never expected to have a company and a lot of people working for me, my name on all kinds of standards, and customers all over the world. But it worked out that way.”This article appears in the March 2026 print issue as “Alan DeKok.”",

        "text": "From bricks-and-mortar stores to the rise of e-commerce, the world of retail has transformed over the past few decades to suit the convenience of shoppers. Spearheading a new age of retail, Alibaba recently hosted an interactive pop-up in an effort to push the experience of AI in fashion even further. A stone’s throw from Milan’s luxury fashion district, “Alibaba Wonder on Ice” offered onlookers the chance to explore an alternative approach to browsing, shopping and styling. By repurposing its trademark AI and cloud technologies – including its Qwen3 series of large language and vision models, Wan 2.2 image-to-video generation model, as well as Taobao Vision’s immersive shopping solution – the experience was designed to generate personalized fashion and beauty recommendations based on current style choices. As captured in a step-by-step video, Hypebeast’s editor kickstarted the AI experience by taking an image on the AI agent, which was swiftly turned into an avatar for the base of the styling process. They were then asked a few questions, such as preferred colors, go-to hairstyles and, in celebration of the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026, their favorite winter sports. Once the prompts were input, Alibaba curated a series of outfits from its fashion catalog, materializing the virtual world into a wardrobe refresh. The experience, though, didn’t stop there as the AI agent proposed several makeup looks as well as a cutting-edge process for choosing your own unique fragrance inspired by a wide range of worldly scents. The newly styled avatar, along with others created by attendees of the experience, was then projected on a gigantic snow globe pavilion outside the space to showcase the final creations. This featured alongside an exhibition comprising 100 digital works of winter sports, similarly created by fans using Alibaba’s Cloud AIGC to complement the digitally generated “Wonder on Ice” outfits.

The lines in the sand dividing peptide from drug are just as arbitrary as those dividing supplement and drug, and just as driven by funding and the high cost of regulatory compliance.

Expression can be increased via gene therapy vectors, or reduced via various approaches, such as small interfering RNA, that attack some part of the process of gene expression.
