Geopolitics & Diplomacy
• Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei was confirmed dead after joint U.S.-Israeli strikes, prompting global calls for restraint and an emergency UN Security Council session condemning the attacks and urging a return to negotiations.
• In Washington, a fierce war powers debate intensified as Republicans largely backed President Trump’s action while Democrats pushed for legislation to reassert Congress’s role; analysts note Trump’s shift from past criticism of regime change, with Netanyahu seen as advocating a broader push in Iran.
• Australia’s foreign minister backed the strikes while seeking clarity on their legal basis; world leaders voiced cautious reactions and moved to protect citizens in the region.
• Defense-tech ties drew attention as OpenAI announced a Pentagon deal with “technical safeguards” while Anthropic’s Pentagon dispute spurred surging consumer interest in its app.
Why it matters: A sudden leadership vacuum in Iran and escalatory strikes are reshaping Middle East diplomacy, testing U.S. domestic constraints, and highlighting the growing role of technology firms in defense.

Armed Conflict & Security
• Iran launched missiles and drones at Israel and Gulf states hosting U.S. bases after “Operation Epic Fury” killed Khamenei; debris injured civilians in Qatar, explosions hit Dubai and others, and authorities reported a devastating strike on a school in Iran.
• U.S. officials framed the strikes as necessary to protect allies, while Iran’s UN envoy called them a “war crime”; analysts warned American assets and Gulf oil supplies are vulnerable as conflict spreads.
• The war disrupted flights across the Middle East, effectively closing Dubai’s main airport, and triggered shipping suspensions and market anxiety; betting site Polymarket faced backlash after heavy wagering on strike timing.
Why it matters: Rapid escalation across multiple countries raises the risk of wider regional war, civilian harm, and major disruptions to aviation, shipping, and energy.
