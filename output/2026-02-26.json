        "title": "Louvre Museum director resigns in the wake of October’s brazen French crown jewels heist",
        "text": "People queue outside the Louvre museum, in Paris, France, Friday, Feb. 13, 2026. (AP Photo/Michel Euler)2026-02-24T17:20:38Z\n                                        PARIS (AP) — The Louvre Museum’s director resigned Tuesday after months of pressure following the October theft of the French crown jewels, as the world’s most visited museum faced widening scrutiny over security failures, labor unrest and a suspected ticket fraud scheme.Laurence des Cars quit after a punishing year for the former royal palace — the high-profile jewels heist from the Apollo Gallery, a mid-February burst pipe near the “Mona Lisa,” water leaks damaging priceless books, staff walkouts and a wildcat strike over overcrowding and understaffing.The landmark has faced a narrative of an institution spiraling out of control. And that pressure deepened in recent weeks when French authorities revealed a suspected decadelong ticket fraud operation linked to the museum that investigators say may have cost the Louvre 10 million euros ($11.8 million).\n    \n        \n    \n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron accepted des Cars’ resignation as “an act of responsibility” at a moment when the Louvre needs “calm” and new momentum for security upgrades, modernization and other major projects, according to a statement from his office.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nMacron wants to give des Cars a new mission during France’s presidency of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, focused on cooperation among major museums, the statement said.For many in France’s cultural world, the resignation answers months of head-scratching over why no top official had fallen after the heist: a daylight robbery that many in the country saw as the most humiliating breach of French heritage security in living memory. It also came as lawmakers and cultural officials widened scrutiny of the museum’s leadership and security practices in the months since the breach.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nBrazen theftThieves took less than eight minutes in October to steal crown jewels valued at 88 million euros ($102 million) from the Louvre, in a weekend operation that stunned visitors, exposed glaring vulnerabilities and left one of France’s most symbolically charged collections in criminal hands. Several suspects were later arrested, but the stolen pieces remain missing.Des Cars, one of the most prominent museum directors in Europe, had offered to resign on the day of the robbery, but it was initially refused by the culture minister. In remarks after the theft, she described the moment as a “tragic, brutal, violent reality” for the Louvre and said that, as the person in charge, it had felt right to offer her resignation.\n    \n        \n    \n\nLightning rodIn an interview published on Tuesday by daily newspaper Le Figaro, des Cars said that she had tried to steer the Louvre through the fallout from the heist, but had concluded that she could no longer carry out the museum’s transformation in the current institutional climate.Staying on, she said, would have meant managing the status quo when the museum still needs deep reform.“I was there to take the lightning” as museum director, she said.Des Cars also said that the October break-in exposed problems that she had been warning about since taking office, including aging infrastructure, obsolete technical systems and severe congestion.She had led the Louvre since 2021, taking over one of the museum world’s most prestigious jobs as the institution emerged from the coronavirus pandemic and mass tourism returned.\n    \n        \n    \n\nMultifaceted crisisIn June, a wildcat strike by front-of-house staff and security workers forced the Louvre to halt operations, stranding thousands of visitors outside the glass pyramid and underscoring the depth of anger among employees over overcrowding, understaffing and what unions called untenable working conditions. Workers said that the pressure of daily visitor flows — particularly around the “Mona Lisa” — had become unmanageable and that promised reforms were arriving too slowly. There were growing complaints that the infrastructure and staffing of the crumbling medieval structure haven’t kept pace with the crowds pouring through its galleries.The resignation came at an especially punishing moment, less than two weeks after French authorities revealed the separate ticket fraud scheme.That case widened scrutiny beyond the jewels robbery and toward the museum’s day-to-day controls. \n    \n        \n    \n\nFraud schemeProsecutors say tour guides are suspected of — up to 20 times a day — reusing the same tickets to bring in different visitor groups, at times allegedly with the help of Louvre employees, in a system investigators believe operated for a decade.In a rare interview just days ago with The Associated Press after the fraud case was made public, the Louvre’s No. 2, general administrator Kim Pham, said that fraud at an institution the size of the Louvre was “statistically inevitable.” He argued that the museum’s sheer scale — millions of visitors, multiple checkpoints and a sprawling historic complex — makes it uniquely exposed. But he also acknowledged shortcomings, and said that the museum had tightened validation checks and increased controls.\n    \n        \n    \n\nNew RenaissanceThe succession of crises has put new political weight on a project Macron has heavily championed: the Louvre’s sweeping overhaul plan, branded the “Louvre New Renaissance.”Unveiled by Macron in January 2025, the renovation, which could take up to a decades, aims to modernize a museum widely seen as overstretched and physically worn down by mass tourism. The plan includes a new entrance near the Seine River to ease pressure on I.M. Pei’s pyramid, new underground spaces and a dedicated room for the “Mona Lisa” with timed access — all intended to improve crowd flow and reduce the daily crush that has become a symbol of the Louvre’s success and its dysfunction. The project is expected to cost roughly 700 million-800 million euros ($826 million-$944 million), with funding from ticket revenue, state support, donations and Louvre Abu Dhabi-related income. The scale and cost of that plan now loom over the search for des Cars’ successor.Macron has framed the overhaul as a national priority, comparing its ambition to other landmark French restoration efforts and casting it as part of a broader defense of French cultural prestige. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                THOMAS ADAMSON\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Adamson is a foreign reporter based in Paris for The Associated Press.

I’m an anthropologist who explores how people think about food and use food in their everyday lives. As executive director of a large food justice organization focused on K-12 education throughout the city, Randy was a key source. He talked to me about South Central’s status as a food desert, where its majority Latinx and Black residents had little access to groceries or healthy food. A middle-aged white man, Randy told me of his work in South Central, which centered around encouraging school-age children to eat more fresh vegetables.He described South Central as a wasteland of sorts. “There is just nothing there,” he said, pointing to the common but false idea that there were no grocery stores there. He then pivoted to talking about the residents. “I see them having almost zero education when it comes to [making healthy eating choices]. They don’t know that what they’re eating is destroying them slowly. It’s just that we, as a society, have failed our citizens to educate them that they shouldn’t be buying the fries every day.”Hanna Garth is assistant professor of anthropology at Princeton University Continue reading...",

Now the challenge for him is to make that message stick.His address Tuesday was a declaration of pride in the achievements of his still-young second term, as he boasted of an economic renaissance at home while he’s imposed a new world order abroad. Trump is getting his first opportunity to test drive that midterm year message later this week, when he travels to Texas, where the Latino voters whose shift toward Trump in his successful 2024 reelection campaign highlighted how he had reshaped the Republican coalition.\n            \n                \n                    \n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n                    President Donald Trump delivers the State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress in the House chamber at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Feb. 24, 2026.

Trump also has a proclivity to go off-script during political rallies, such as during a speech last week in Rome, Georgia, asserting he’s “solved” affordability when high prices remain a chief concern for voters.\n    \n        \n    \n\nStill, the themes of economic prosperity and a more secure America that Trump emphasized in his 108-minute speech Tuesday will underpin the broader narrative he and his fellow Republicans will seek to sell to voters this November.

President Joe Biden, for instance, went to swing states such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania the day after his speech in the last two years of his term. Vice President JD Vance will be first to hit the road with a Thursday visit to a Wisconsin factory. Trump won’t leave the Washington area until Friday, when he heads to Texas, to talk about the economy and energy policies just days ahead of the state’s March 3 congressional primaries. On the day after the State of the Union, the president will spend much of his time participating in meetings at the White House, including policy sessions and a sit-down with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. But Trump — who wove a series of made-for-social media surprises into his address — is known for being able to command attention in a fractured news environment, and he’s likely to find other ways to break through aside from the usual post-State of the Union blitz.“Donald Trump is a master at the big moments, so he obviously cares a lot about how the speech goes, but what he cares a lot about are the clips that get replayed over and over again from the State of the Union,” said Austin Cantrell, who served as an assistant White House press secretary in Trump’s first term.Cantrell, who’s now with the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based firm Bridge Public Affairs, said: “I don’t expect this to be some Aaron Sorkin-esque, perfectly choreographed post-State of the Union media fan-out.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nSix years ago, it was Trump’s move to award conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America’s highest civilian honor, that surprised the audience. Tuesday’s address — record-breaking in its length — included similar attention-grabbing moments. He said he’d give the same honor to Connor Hellebuyck, goaltender for the U.S. men’s hockey team, fresh off winning a gold medal at the Winter Olympics in Milano-Cortina, Italy. Trump called Hellebuyck and his teammates into the House chamber, where they were greeted with applause. \n    \n        \n    \n\nWhite House says Trump will get out on the trail for his partyTrump also used his speech to roll out new proposals to address affordability concerns, while castigating Democrats for opposing policies he said have led to a more prosperous, safer America. Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger, in Democrats’ response, argued costs remain high for many Americans and families are still struggling under Trump’s policies.Trump called on both parties to “protect American citizens, not illegal aliens,” and pushed for measures to limit mail-in ballots and tighten voter identification rules, while warning about the dangers of unchecked, illegal migration. “I do think a lot of the success outlined in the State of the Union will be a part of the Republican message in the fall,” Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., another close Trump ally, told the AP, pointing to the GOP’s achievements on tax policy and border security. “As far as the president is concerned, I think he’ll be anxious to get on the road and talk about the success.” \n            \n                \n                    \n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n                    Sen.

He so far has hit critical battleground states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina on his economy tour, but he also traveled to reliably conservative Iowa and the congressional district of former Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. He has boosted candidates — in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, he bantered with Republican Michael Whatley and promoted his Senate run — while sometimes veering far away from the economic points the trips are meant to emphasize. \n    \n        \n    \n\nJust the optics of leaving Washington can help telegraph to voters that a president cares about connecting with them. Edward Frantz, a historian at the University of Indianapolis, said Herbert Hoover — an engineer, self-made millionaire and technocrat — believed he could solve the nation’s ills by working with his team in isolation and rarely leaving Washington. That led to a perception among voters that Hoover simply didn’t care, because they didn’t see him connecting with Americans. “If you think about a call and response ... the call is the State of the Union, and if you really do care about being in touch with others, then what’s the response?” Frantz said. “The best way to be able to see that is by hitting the road.” How Americans feel about Trump has remained relatively stable throughout his second term, making it unlikely that one speech will meaningfully shift the way he’s perceived. His approval rating has changed very little during his second term, Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research polling has found, falling only slightly from 42% in March 2025 to 36% in early February.Nevertheless, the annual address offers Trump the chance to reframe his message, just as it has for presidents who came before him.Presidential historian Timothy Naftali pointed out that in 1996, Bill Clinton used his State of the Union to set the themes of his Democratic reelection campaign.

Bush’s midterm drubbing in November 2006, the Republican struck a noticeably more conciliatory tone toward the new Democratic leadership that had just taken charge on Capitol Hill.“The State of the Union, they’re less important than they once were because with a president like Trump, he’s always available,” said Naftali, a senior research scholar at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University. “But the State of the Union is an opportunity to reset the president’s agenda or to reaffirm it, and resetting an agenda in the social media era is different from resetting it in previous times.”___Associated Press polling editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux contributed to this report.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                SEUNG MIN KIM\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Kim covers the White House for The Associated Press.

        "text": "Akron Stadium, a venue for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, stands in Guadalajara, Mexico, Tuesday, Jan. 24, 2026. (AP Photo/Marco Ugarte)2026-02-25T17:51:32Z\n                                        MEXICO CITY (AP) — The violence that erupted in Mexico after the death of a powerful drug lord has left many questioning whether the country will be able to co-host the World Cup in just over three months. FIFA President Gianni Infantino thinks it can. “Of course, we are monitoring the situation in Mexico these days, but I want to say from the outset that we have complete confidence in Mexico, in its president, Claudia Sheinbaum, and in the authorities, and we are convinced that everything will go as smoothly as possible,” Infantino said late Tuesday in a press conference in Colombia. “Mexico is a great country, like in every country in the world, things happen; we don’t live on the moon or another planet,” Infantino added. “That’s why we have governments, police, and authorities who will ensure order and security.” The Mexican army killed Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, “El Mencho,” who led the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, on Sunday, sparking several days of violence. Cartel members burned cars and blocked roads in nearly a dozen Mexican states and authorities report that at least 70 people have died.\n    \n        \n    \n\nFour high-level soccer matches from the local leagues were postponed last Sunday, including one in the central city of Queretaro, where Mexico is scheduled to play against Iceland late Wednesday in a friendly match.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThirteen World Cup matches are scheduled to be held in Mexico, including the opening game in Mexico City on June 11 between the co-host and South Africa. Guadalajara, the central hub for the Jalisco cartel, is scheduled to host four.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nColombia is set to play one game in Mexico City and one in Guadalajara.“Our first two matches are in Mexico, but we know they will overcome this and move forward,” said Ramón Jesurún, the president of the Colombian Soccer Federation. “I have absolute and total confidence in my geopolitical thinking that this is an issue Mexico will overcome, and overcome very quickly.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nOther nations have expressed more concern. The Portuguese soccer federation said Tuesday that it was closely monitoring developments ahead of a planned friendly against Mexico in March. Jamaica is set to play New Caledonia in Guadalajara on March 26 in an intercontinental playoff semifinal, with the winner advancing to face Congo for a World Cup spot. “The games are at the end of March, so we still have another month to see what happens; but it is making me very nervous, to be honest,” said Michael Ricketts, the president of the Jamaican Soccer Federation. “We will be listening out for CONCACAF and FIFA to give us instructions (on) whether they are playing the games or whether they are immediately looking for other options.”Another Mexican city, Monterrey, will host a playoff where Bolivia plays Suriname and the winner faces Iraq for a spot in the tournament.On Monday, Sheinbaum said there is “every guarantee” that the World Cup matches in Guadalajara will be played as planned and added that there was “no risk.” “We are in regular contact with the presidency and the authorities in Mexico and we are monitoring the situation,” Infantino said. “The World Cup is going to be an incredible celebration”.___AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n                    \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n                    \n    获取更多RSS：https://feedx.net https://feedx.site",

He was the subject of a “60 Minutes” profile that ran on the network last October.But shortly after the appointment, Attia’s name surfaced in hundreds of Epstein documents. While Attia said he was guilty of no wrongdoing and did not attend any of Epstein’s sex parties, he admitted in an apology earlier this month that some of his emails were “embarrassing, tasteless and indefensible.”Despite some public pressure, CBS News did not cut ties with Attia after the documents surfaced. Instead, Attia resigned from the network on his own, according to published reports confirmed by CBS News on Monday.Attia is one of several public figures, including some in the corporate and public sectors, whose relationships with Epstein have surfaced in recent weeks, causing resignations.",

        "text": "Family members of the people who were killed in the midair collision near Washington Reagan National Airport listen during a news conference as Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., speaks, not shown, on Capitol Hill, Tuesday, Feb. 24, 2026, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib)2026-02-24T13:29:15Z\n                                        The House failed to approve a bill Tuesday that was crafted after last year’s tragic midair collision near Washington, D.C., to require all aircraft flying around busy airports to have key locator systems to prevent such crashes. The collision of an airliner and an Army helicopter killed 67 people in January 2025.The National Transportation Safety Board has been recommending such Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast systems to be installed since 2008. The bill that already passed the Senate would have required aircraft to be equipped with a system that can receive data about the locations of other aircraft. The complementary ADS-B Out system that broadcasts an aircraft’s location is already required.The families of the victims who died when an American Airlines jet collided with an Army Black Hawk helicopter strongly supported the measure, and a number of them watched the vote from the House gallery. But the Airlines for American trade group, the military and the major general aviation groups that represent business jets and small plane owners backed a competing and more comprehensive House bill that was just introduced last week. \n    \n        \n    \n\nTim Lilley, whose son Sam was the first officer on the airliner, said he’s really disappointed, but he and the other families will continue to press for meaningful reforms. And he hopes that will happen before the next tragedy.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n“We’re going to end up back here having the same conversation because of another midair (collision) is what’s going to happen. Hopefully — fingers crossed — that doesn’t,” Lilley said.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nUnder the special process that was used to fast-track the bill, the ROTOR Act needed to receive more than two-thirds support to pass the House. It received 264 votes, but 133 other representatives voted against it. ROTOR stands for “Rotorcraft Operations Transparency and Oversight Reform.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson told The Associated Press that the Senate and the House will work together to get an aviation safety bill done. “We’re committed to it,” he said. And House Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Committee Chairman Sam Graves said the House bill could be marked up in committee as soon as next week. That bill is designed to address all 50 of the recommendations the NTSB made, not just the locator technology, but NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy has said the House bill falls short of accomplishing that. But Lilley said the bill Graves helped write needs to be strengthened.“They’ve had 18 years to get it right. He’s talking about getting it right and he’s not even close on the collision avoidance piece,” he said.The cost of the ADS-B In mandate has been a concern. It’s not clear exactly how much it would cost partly because the systems haven’t yet been designed and certified for every aircraft, but Homendy testified in Congress that American Airlines was able to equip more than 300 of its Airbus a321s for $50,000 apiece, and general aviation pilots have the option of using a portable receiver that costs about $400 and works with an iPad.\n    \n        \n    \n\nOne of the key researchers who helped develop these locator systems, Fabrice Kunzi, said a plane’s dashboard shouldn’t have to be overhauled to add a new display because the system is designed to give pilots an audible warning about nearby traffic with details of their locations if there is a risk of a collision.\n    \n        \n    \n\nHouse and Senate bills took a different approachThe key difference between the bills is that the House version would not require both kinds of the proven Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast systems to be installed. Instead, the House bill would require the Federal Aviation Administration to investigate what technology might be best as part of a lengthy rulemaking process before requiring a solution. The House bill also covers many more aspects of the systemic failures the NTSB identified as causing the crash on the evening of Jan. 29, 2025. The bipartisan group of Senate leaders behind the ROTOR Act — led by Republican Ted Cruz and Democrat Maria Cantwell — had argued their bill would be a good first step before drafting additional legislation.Cruz pledged to keep working to pass his bill, which earned bipartisan support Tuesday, because it would require all aircraft to play by the same set of rules. “We will succeed, and ROTOR Act will become the law of the land,” he said. “The families and the flying public deserve nothing less.”The main Families of Flight 5342 group had said that while the House bill includes a number of good reforms that should be considered, they can’t support it as written because it doesn’t clearly require ADS-B In equipment. Everyone aboard the helicopter and the American Airlines jet flying from Wichita, Kansas, including the parents of Olympic figure skater Maxim Naumov and 26 other members of the figure skating community, died when the aircraft collided and plummeted into the icy Potomac River.\n    \n        \n    \n\nSara Nelson, who is the president of the Association of Flight Attendants, said her union will keep pushing for changes because bill that failed “was the clearest and most direct way to avoid midair collisions.”Doug Lane said that as he learned more about the crash that killed his wife and 16-year-old figure-skating son, he couldn’t understand why airplanes aren’t already equipped with technology that was first recommended before his son was born, and he’s angry the bill failed Tuesday. He said the House bill is a poor substitute because too many of its provisions just call for a study or rulemaking without requiring actual change and there are loopholes.Lane said the House bill is “a clear effort to just punt ADS-B In into a place where it can just go and die. It was not a good-faith effort to come up with a better way to do collision avoidance technology.”Improving the collision warning system Any plane flying around a major airport is already required to have an ADS-B Out system that continually broadcasts an aircraft’s location and speed installed. ADS-B In systems that can receive those signals and be used to create a display showing pilots where all air traffic is located around them are not standard on airliners, though many general aviation pilots already use a portable receiver to display that information on an iPad. The NTSB investigation showed that system would have provided significantly more warning to the pilots involved in the crash and would have allowed them to avoid the collision. A plane equipped with ADS-B In can give the pilot a detailed description of where other aircraft are, whereas the current technology can only warn that traffic is in the area. Cantwell, the Washington Democrat, said most House Republicans “voted to protect loopholes that helped cause the DCA (Reagan Airport) midair collision rather than acting with urgency to prevent crashes like this from happening again. The families deserve better.” Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-N.Y., who is chairman of an aviation safety caucus, voted for the bill. He said he was puzzled by the Pentagon’s last-minute shift on the bill. He also noted there were many absences among House members due to weather, which also affected the outcome.He said he is sure that the families of the crash victims are disappointed after the vote.“But I don’t think they should be completely dejected. I do think there are avenues to bring it back,” Langworthy said. “There’s will to solve this problem.”____Associated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report from Washington.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JOSH FUNK\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Funk is an Associated Press reporter who covers transportation including aviation safety and airlines along with all the major freight railroads.

        "title": "What to know about the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning after college student’s death",
        "text": "This photo provided by Salve Regina University shows Joseph Boutros, student at the college, posing for a photo on the Salve Regina University campus in Newport, R.I., Sept. 2025. (Clara Maurer/Salve Regina University via AP)2026-02-25T21:17:48Z\n                                        A Rhode Island college football player died from carbon monoxide poisoning after he tried to charge his phone in his car during a massive snow storm in a power outage.The storm knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of people across the Northeast.First responders found 21-year-old Salve Regina University student Joseph Boutros unresponsive in his car on Monday in Newport, Rhode Island, where he was parked outside of a university building. Police said the vehicle’s exhaust pipe was obstructed by snow and that his death from carbon monoxide poisoning was accidental. The area didn’t have power at the time and Boutros told a fellow student that he was using his car to charge his phone, Newport Police Captain Joseph Carroll said. The university’s football team said they were “heartbroken” about Boutros’ death, which they announced in an Instagram post.\n    \n        \n    \n\nMany Rhode Island residents faced a third straight morning stuck in their homes on Wednesday as some residential streets remain unplowed. Blizzards present a host of hazards, ranging from slippery ice to severe cold. But one of the most lethal risks posed by heavy snowfall is completely undetectable to humans. Here is what to know about the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning — especially during power outages and cold weather.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nTime of year with highest risk of carbon monoxide poisoningThe risk of carbon monoxide poisoning is higher in the winter and after heavy snowfall, according to the Centers for Disease Control. During cold weather, people are more likely to use furnaces and heaters that emit the lethal gas. A number of malfunctions can obstruct proper ventilation, including snowfall that can block exhaust pipes or vents. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nHow does carbon monoxide affect the bodyCarbon monoxide is often referred to as the “silent killer” because it is odorless, colorless and tasteless. Prolonged exposure to carbon monoxide reduces the ability of blood to carry oxygen to the body’s organs.It can cause throbbing headaches, disorientation and drowsiness, followed by unconsciousness, convulsions and eventually death. \n    \n        \n    \n\nWhy people die from exposure in the winterWhen people use heating systems without proper air flow or ventilation — such as running their car in a closed garage, bringing grills inside or using gas stoves for personal heat — carbon monoxide can build up and become dangerous. That is especially common in tragic cases like the one that led to Boutros’ death on Monday, where people wait in their cars for long periods of time without realizing that an exhaust pipe is obstructed.One of the most notable examples happened in 1978, when a snowstorm dropped two feet (0.6 meters) of snow across New England over the course of roughly 30 hours. Snow fell so fast that it trapped roughly 3,000 cars and 500 trucks along eight miles (13km) of one highway in Massachusetts, according to the New England Historical Society. That year, 14 people died of carbon monoxide poisoning while sitting in their snowbound vehicles.But the risk is not limited to just cars. More than three dozen people died in a historic 2022 storm, and at least one died from snow covering furnaces and sending carbon monoxide into their New York homes.\n    \n        \n    \n\nHow to know whether it’s safe to stay in a carSitting in an idling car for a long time is usually safe, according to Jake Fisher, the senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports. But drivers should keep an eye out for warning signs and have them inspected annually. Vehicles are more prone to exhaust leaks after a crash and should be inspected before they are put back on the road.“Engines emit a lot of very dangerous chemicals and gases,” Fisher said. “If your car is not running right and you hear it sounding funny, you really do need to get it checked out.”",

        "text": "In this May 15, 2013, file photo, &quot;King of the Nerds&quot; co-hosts Robert Carradine attends the TNT and TBS 2013 Upfront at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File)2026-02-24T13:41:26Z\n                                        Robert Carradine, the youngest of his prolific Hollywood family and whose biggest hit was the 1984 comedy “Revenge of the Nerds,” has died at 71.In a Tuesday statement, his family said he lived with bipolar disorder for two decades. His brother told Deadline that Carradine died by suicide.“We want people to know it, and there is no shame in it,” Keith Carradine told Deadline. “It is an illness that got the best of him, and I want to celebrate him for his struggle with it, and celebrate his beautiful soul. He was profoundly gifted, and we will miss him every day.” ___EDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988.___Known for both his film and television work, Robert Carradine worked steadily in the industry for over 40 years. Though he collaborated with some of the most respected directors of the day, he never gained the worldwide recognition of his more famous siblings Keith Carradine (also the father of Martha Plimpton) and half-brother David Carradine, who died in 2009. \n    \n        \n    \n\nRobert Carradine, a Los Angeles native and son to character actor John Carradine, was introduced to audiences with roles on the television series “Bonanza” in 1971 and in the John Wayne Western “The Cowboys” in 1972.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nDespite his family background, acting wasn’t his first calling, though.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“I always had a passion to be a race car driver, and that’s what I thought I was going to do, and at some penultimate moment … I think I was sitting with my brother David when ‘The Cowboys’ was being cast, and they were interested in David as the bad guy, and he didn’t want to be the guy that shot John Wayne in the back,” Carradine recalled in a 2013 interview with Popdose. “But he said, ‘You know, it is called The Cowboys, and they’re meeting all these young guys. Why don’t you go in?’”\n    \n        \n    \n\nIn addition to starring in a short-lived television spinoff of “The Cowboys,” and appearing alongside David Carradine in his popular ABC series “Kung Fu,” he would go on to nab roles in Martin Scorsese’s “Mean Streets,” Hal Ashby’s Vietnam drama “Coming Home,” and Samuel Fuller’s World War II film “The Big Red One.”The heights of his brother David’s success eluded Robert Carradine, but the two could often be seen in the same projects, including in Walter Hill’s “The Long Riders” and Paul Bartel’s “Cannonball.”Robert Carradine’s biggest hit would come in 1984 with the off-color comedy “Revenge of the Nerds,” in which he played head nerd Lewis Skolnick, with his abrupt, infectious and guttural laugh. He reprised the role for the big-screen sequel and two made-for-television follow-ups, and continued to pay homage to the beloved character with a guest role on the series “Robot Chicken” and as a co-host (with “Revenge of the Nerds” co-star Curtis Armstrong) of the pop culture competition show “King of the Nerds,” which aired for three seasons.In the late 1980s and 1990s, according to the family statement, Carradine realized his racing ambitions and was a driver for Lotus. In the 2000s, Carradine gained small-screen success in The Disney Channel’s “Lizzie McGuire” as the eponymous character’s father.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“It’s really hard to face this reality about an old friend,” Hilary Duff, who played Lizzie McGuire, wrote on Instagram. “There was so much warmth in the McGuire family and I always felt so cared for by my on-screen parents. I’ll be forever grateful for that. I’m deeply sad to learn Bobby was suffering.”Work remained consistent even if the projects diminished in prestige and quality. Then Quentin Tarantino, ever the champion of fading character actors, cast Carradine in “Django Unchained” as one of the trackers in the 2012 film after seeing a “very furry” photograph, as Carradine told Popdose. In 2015, Carradine was cited for a Colorado crash that injured him and his wife, Edith Mani. They later divorced, after more than 25 years of marriage.Carradine’s survivors include his three children, actor Ever Carradine, Marika Reed Carradine and Ian Alexander Carradine.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“Whenever anyone asks me how I turned out so normal, I always tell them it’s because of my dad. I knew my dad loved me, I knew it deep in my bones, and I always knew he had my back,” Ever Carradine wrote on Instagram. “I think it’s partly because we basically grew up together. Twenty years age difference really isn’t that much, and while I never ever thought of him as a sibling, I did always think of him as my partner. We were in it together.”\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                LINDSEY BAHR\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Bahr has been a film writer and critic for The Associated Press since 2014.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        instagram\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto",

The heavy-duty footwear is constructed from premium Horween leather, utilizing a pebbled finish that adds depth, texture, and a vintage character designed to improve with age.

        "text": "Francis Santana, who works for a tree service from Rhode Island, clears downed limbs so power can be restored after a winter storm dumped more than two feet of snow across the region, Wednesday, Feb. 25, 2026, in Plymouth, Mass. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)2026-02-25T05:01:44Z\n                                        PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Power failures, waist-high canyons of snow and more flurries Wednesday bedeviled parts of the Northeast in the aftermath of a massive storm that dumped icy piles on streets and sidewalks from Maryland to Maine. The fallout persisted across the region: In Rhode Island, where 3 feet (0.9 meters) of snow surpassed the record set in the Blizzard of 1978, people were stuck in their homes for a third straight day as residential streets remained unplowed, trash pickup got postponed in places and some schools went virtual. More than 138,000 customers were still without power Wednesday afternoon, nearly all of them in Massachusetts and particularly in Cape Cod, according to poweroutage.us. Utility crews were working 18-hour shifts to restore electricity and people huddled in warming shelters for respite and to recharge phones.\n    \n        \n    \n\nAnny Enos took her three grandchildren to a warming station in Barnstable, Massachusetts, on Wednesday to charge their devices and get a change of scenery. She said she hasn’t had power since Sunday afternoon and was afraid that she might not get it back until Friday.\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n        \n                \n            \n        \n                \n            \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    AP AUDIO: More snow falls on the Northeast US, where huge piles remain from the last storm\n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    In an AP interview, National Weather Service forecaster Bob Oravec says additional light snow moved out across the Great Lakes and into the Northeast overnight.\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nShe threw out most of her fridge Tuesday and was just hoping for the best.“I hate to say it but it doesn’t seem like they were ready,” she said.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nReinforcements, overtime and thousands of ‘emergency shovelers’The storm created “thousands” of damage sites that required workers in some cases to remove big snow piles with backhoes before new poles could be installed or old ones repaired, according to Doug Foley, president of electric operations for Eversource in Massachusetts. More crews from other states arrived to help on Wednesday.Most unwelcome, up to 3 more inches (7.6 centimeters) of snow fell early Wednesday, adding to slippery conditions before temperatures rose, creating slushy messes.The gigantic snowstorm this week has cities working overtime to clear towering heaps. In New York City, Mayor Zohran Mamdani got creative: in addition to spreading 143 million pounds (65 million kilograms) of salt by Tuesday evening, the city signed up at least 3,500 people as emergency shovelers, working $30-per-hour shifts to clear snow from bus stops and streets.\n    \n        \n    \n\nPolice said carbon monoxide poisoning killed a man in an area of Rhode Island that had lost power. Joseph Boutrous, 21, had told a fellow Salve Regina student he was going to charge his phone in his car, Newport Police Capt. Joseph Carroll said. The exhaust pipe was obstructed by snow, police said, calling his death accidental. The sophomore from Bohemia, New York was an offensive lineman on the football team. A social media post said his teammates are heartbroken. Some sidewalks are impassable for people with disabilitiesThere was plenty more work left to do. Parts of New York have people feeling marooned, according to Jeff Peters, spokesperson for the Center for Independence of the Disabled, New York.“You’ll find a portion of a sidewalk that is clear, and then there’s maybe a 6-inch (15-centimeter) pathway that can only be walked with one foot in front of the other and no room for a stroller, rollator, walker or crutches,” Peters said. “Then you get to the corner and not only is it unshoveled, but you have basically a glacier at the end of it.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nTina Guenette, who uses a motorized wheelchair, had to shovel out her yard this week after more than 33 inches (84 centimeters) fell in Harrisville, Rhode Island, a town about 17 miles (27 kilometers) northwest of Providence.“I really have no choice if my service dog wants to go outside,” Guenette said. Harrisville’s volunteer snow-shoveling program hasn’t had volunteers for years, she said.The storm unleashed massive amounts of snowMonday’s storm blanketed the region with snow, canceled flights, disrupted transit and downed power lines.Crunching the numbers, meteorologist Ryan Maue, former chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, calculated that all that snow held a total of 2.5 trillion gallons of water.If all the snow that fell from Maryland to Maine fell just on Manhattan, it would have towered over a mile high. If the snowfall blanketed only on Rhode Island, which got hit hardest, it would bury the entire Ocean State in more than 92 feet of snow, The Associated Press estimated.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n\nMelted, it’s enough to fill the Empire State Building with water more than 9,000 times. New York State got the water equivalent of 680 billion gallons, while Pennsylvania got 410 billion gallons and Massachusetts got 28 billion.When it eventually melts, it will help mitigate the drought affecting parts of the Northeast, Maue said, but right now it’s adding misery to an already punishing season.“I think this storm took a severe winter and turned it into an extreme winter or a record extreme winter,” he said.In New York City, workers were setting up massive basins of warm water where large amounts of snow and ice will be dumped, acting Sanitation Commissioner Javier Lojan said. They helped melt 23 million pounds (11.5 metric tons) of snow during last month’s storm.Snowbound Providence, Rhode Island, is trucking snow to five locations, and more dumping grounds may be added, according to Josh Estrella, communications director for the city government.\n    \n        \n    \n\nSchools in NYC returning to normal. Not so much in Rhode Island, parts of MassachusettsSome large school districts moved back to in-person classes on Wednesday, including Philadelphia, which had switched to online learning during the first two days of the week. Schools reopened in Boston after being closed since last week for the winter break. But in hardest-hit Rhode Island, Providence officials decided to keep schools closed and switch to virtual learning for the rest of the week.In New York City, it was another regular school day for more than 900,000 students in the nation’s largest public school system, but many students and their caregivers had to scramble over mountainous snow banks and dodge salt spreaders during the morning drop-off.Thousands of flights in and out of the U.S. have been canceled in recent days. By Wednesday the disruptions seemed to be subsiding, with nearly 200 grounded, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. Rhode Island’s T.F. Green International Airport reopened Tuesday. Some flights departed Wednesday, while others were canceled.When Jamie Meyers’ flight landed in New York from Buenos Aires, Argentina, Tuesday evening, the cabin full of relieved passengers burst into applause. The Manhattan resident was supposed to arrive home Sunday but faced a cancellation and significant delay.___Kruesi reported from Providence and Barnstable, Massachusetts; Willingham from Boston; and Offenhartz from New York; Associated Press writers Matt O’Brien in Providence, Rhode Island; Seth Borenstein in Washington; Jennifer Peltz and Philip Marcelo in New York; Mike Catalini in Morrisville, Pennsylvania; Mark Scolforo in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Kathy McCormack in Concord, New Hampshire; Hallie Golden in Seattle; Rebecca Boone in Boise, Idaho; and Audrey McAvoy in Honolulu contributed. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n            \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JAKE OFFENHARTZ\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Offenhartz is a general assignment reporter in the New York City bureau of The Associated Press.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto",

        "text": "FILE Christophe Leribault, head of the Charteau de Versailles, poses March 29, 2024 in the park of the Chateau de Versailles, west of Paris. (AP Photo/Thomas Padilla, File)2026-02-25T10:11:05Z\n                                        PARIS (AP) — The home of the “Mona Lisa” is getting a new boss. Art historian Christophe Leribault, a veteran museum director, is taking over at the Louvre, shouldering the challenge of getting the world’s largest museum out of crisis after the brazen heist in October of the French crown jewels.French government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon announced Wednesday that Leribault is taking over from outgoing Louvre director Laurence des Cars, who resigned Tuesday.The difficulties he inherits are formidable.The daylight robbery — among the highest-profile museum thefts in living memory — exposed alarming security holes at the Paris landmark.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe former royal palace has also suffered a broad array of other problems that have presented a picture of a treasured national institution spiraling out of control.They include a burst pipe near the “Mona Lisa,” water leaks that damaged priceless books, aging buildings, staff walkouts over overcrowding, understaffing and ticket price hikes for most non-European visitors.\n    \n        \n    \n\nPressure for new leadership deepened in recent weeks when authorities revealed a suspected decade-long ticket fraud operation linked to the museum that investigators say may have cost the Louvre 10 million euros ($11.8 million).\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nLeribault brings a proven track record. He has been running another world-renowned French landmark and tourist attraction, the Versailles Palace, overseeing an annual budget of about 170 million euros ($200 million). The former palace for French royalty west of Paris was the venue for Olympic equestrian sports when Paris hosted the summer games in 2024.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nLeribault also is a previous head of Paris’ Orsay Museum.“He will be tasked with leading important projects that are crucial for the institution’s future,” Bregeon said as she announced Leribault’s appointment at the Louvre.They include security and modernization upgrades and the pursuit of a sweeping overhaul plan, branded “Louvre New Renaissance,” that President Emmanuel Macron is championing. \n    \n        \n    \n\nUnveiled by Macron in January 2025, the renovation, which could take up to a decade, aims to modernize a museum widely seen as overstretched and physically worn down by mass tourism.The plan includes a new entrance near the Seine River to ease pressure on I.M. Pei’s pyramid, new underground spaces and a dedicated room for the “Mona Lisa” with timed access — all intended to improve crowd flow and reduce the daily crush of visitors that has become a symbol of the Louvre’s success and its dysfunction.The project is expected to cost about 1.15 billion euros ($1.35 billion) according to a recent report from France’s court of auditors. It will be partly funded by ticket revenue, state support, donations and income from the Louvre branch in Abu Dhabi.Bregeon described Leribault as “very solid, trusted” and said he’s expected to provide “vision” and “calm” to the museum.In a statement, the Culture Ministry highlighted “his extensive experience at the helm of major institutions” and said Leribault will prioritize strengthening the security and safety of the Louvre’s buildings, its collections and visitors and staff, and “restoring a climate of trust.” \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                SYLVIE CORBET\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Corbet is an Associated Press reporter based in Paris.

The digital artifact consists of three main components: the front-end code of the watch page, the video file for \"Me at the zoo\" which was initially uploaded on April 23, 2005, and a selection of banner advertisements from the era. Showcasing the lightweight and functional aesthetic of the mid-2000s, the 2006 layout features the video player and comments in a large left column, flanked by related and suggested videos on the right.To bring the dormant web page back to life, the museum collaborated with YouTube's User Experience team and interaction design studio oio. The primary challenge involved bypassing the technological obsolescence of the original custom video player, which was built to run on the now-defunct Adobe Flash Player. Utilizing the open-source Flash emulator Ruffle, the team successfully restored the platform's early functionality. This rigorous reconstruction process, complete with documented code modifications, ensures that a foundational piece of the modern creator economy is preserved and operational in perpetuity.Read more at Hypebeast",

        "title": "Jimi Hendrix Was a Systems Engineer",
        "text": "3 February 1967 is a day that belongs in the annals of music history. It’s the day that Jimi Hendrix entered London’s Olympic Studios to record a song using a new component. The song was “Purple Haze,” and the component was the Octavia guitar pedal, created for Hendrix by sound engineer Roger Mayer. The pedal was a key element of a complex chain of analog elements responsible for the final sound, including the acoustics of the studio room itself. When they sent the tapes for remastering in the United States, the sounds on it were so novel that they included an accompanying note explaining that the distortion at the end was not malfunction but intention. A few months later, Hendrix would deliver his legendary electric guitar performance at the Monterey International Pop Festival. “Purple Haze” firmly established that an electric guitar can be used not just as a stringed instrument with built-in pickups for convenient sound amplification, but also as a full-blown wave synthesizer whose output can be manipulated at will. Modern guitarists can reproduce Hendrix’s chain using separate plug-ins in digital audio workstation software, but the magic often disappears when everything is buffered and quantized. I wanted to find out if a more systematic approach could do a better job and provide insights into how Hendrix created his groundbreaking sound.My fascination with Hendrix’s Olympic Studios’ performance arose because there is a “Hendrix was an alien” narrative surrounding his musical innovation—that his music appeared more or less out of nowhere. I wanted to replace that narrative with an engineering-driven account that’s inspectable and reproducible—plots, models, and a signal chain from the guitar through the pedals that you can probe stage by stage.  Each effects pedal in Hendrix’s chain contributed to enhancing the electric guitar beyond its intrinsic limits. A selection of plots from the full-circuit analysis shows how the Fuzz Face turns a sinusoid signal from a string into an almost square wave; how the Octavia pedal inverts half the input waveform to double its frequency; how the wah-wah pedal acts as band-pass filter; and how the Uni-Vibe pedal introduces selective phase shifts to color the sound.James Provost/ Rohan S. PuranikAlthough I work mostly in the digital domain as an edge-computing architect in my day job, I knew that analog circuit simulations would be the key to going deeper.My first step was to look at the challenges Hendrix was trying to address. Before the 1930s, guitars were too quiet for large ensembles. Electromagnetic pickups—coils of wire wrapped around magnets that detect the vibrations of metal strings—fixed the loudness problem. But they left a new one: the envelope, which specifies how the amplitude of a note varies as it’s played on an instrument, starting with a rising initial attack, followed by a falling decay, and then any sustain of the note after that. Electric guitars attack hard, decay fast, and don’t sustain like bowed strings or organs. Early manufacturers tried to modify the electric guitar’s characteristics by using hollow bodies fitted with magnetic pickups, but the instrument still barked more than it sang.Hendrix’s mission was to reshape both the electric guitar’s envelope and its tone until it could feel like a human voice. He tackled the guitar’s constraints by augmenting it. His solution was essentially a modular analog signal chain driven not by knobs but by hands, feet, gain staging, and physical movement in a feedback field.Hendrix’s setups are well documented: Set lists, studio logs, and interviews with Mayer and Eddie Kramer, then the lead engineer at Olympic Studios, fill in the details. The signal chain for “Purple Haze” consisted of a set of pedals—a Fuzz Face, the Octavia, and a wah-wah—plus a Marshall 100-watt amplifier stack, with the guitar and room acoustics closing a feedback loop that Hendrix tuned with his own body. Later, Hendrix would also incorporate a Uni-Vibe pedal for many of his tracks. All the pedals were commercial models except for the Octavia, which Mayer built to produce a distorted signal an octave higher than its input.Hendrix didn’t speak in decibels and ohm values, but he collaborated with engineers who did.I obtained the schematics for each of these elements and their accepted parameter ranges, and converted them into netlists that ngspice can process (ngpsice is an open source implementation of the Spice circuit analyzer). The Fuzz Face pedal came in two variants, using germanium or silicon transistors, so I created models for both. In my models, Hendrix’s guitar pickups had a resistance of 6 kiloohms and an inductance of 2.5 henrys with a realistic cable capacitance.I chained the circuit simulations together using a script, and I produced data-plot and sample sound outputs with Python scripts. All of the ngspice files and other scripts are available in my GitHub repository at github.com/nahorov/Hendrix-Systems-Lab, with instructions on how to reproduce my simulations.What Does The Analysis of Hendrix’s Signal Chain Tell Us?Plotting the signal at different points in the chain with different parameters reveals how Hendrix configured and manipulated the nonlinear complexities of the system as a whole to reach his expressive goals.A few highlights: First, the Fuzz Face is a two-transistor feedback amplifier that turns a gentle sinusoid signal into an almost binary “fuzzy” output. The interesting behavior emerges when the guitar’s volume is reduced. Because the pedal’s input impedance is very low (about 20 kΩ), the pickups interact directly with the pedal circuit. Reducing amplitude restores a sinusoidal shape—producing the famous “cleanup effect” that was a hallmark of Hendrix’s sound, where the fuzz drops in and out as desired while he played.  The Jimi Hendrix Experience, (left to right) Mitch Mitchel, Jimi Hendrix, Noel ReddingFred W. McDarrah/Getty ImagesSecond, the Octavio pedal used a rectifier, which normally converts alternating to direct current. Mayer realized that a rectifier effectively flips each trough of a waveform into a peak, doubling the number of peaks per second. The result is an apparent doubling of frequency—a bloom of second-harmonic content that the ear hears a bright octave above the fundamental.Third, the wah-wah pedal is a band-pass filter: Frequency plots show the center frequency sweeping from roughly 300 hertz to 2 kilohertz. Hendrix used it to make the guitar “talk” with vowel sounds, most iconically on “Voodoo Child (Slight Return).”Fourth, the Uni-Vibe cascades four phase-shift sections controlled by photoresistors. In circuit terms, it’s a low-frequency oscillator modulating a variable-phase network; in musical terms it’s motion and air.Finally, the whole chain became a closed loop by driving the Marshall amplifier near saturation, which among other things extends the sustain. In a reflective room, the guitar strings couple acoustically to the speakers—move a few centimeters and you shift from one stable feedback mode to another. To an engineer, this is a gain-controlled acoustic feedback system. To Hendrix, it was part of the instrument. He learned to tune oscillation with distance and angle, shaping sirens, bombs, and harmonics by walking the edge of instability.Hendrix didn’t speak in decibels and ohm values, but he collaborated with engineers who did—Mayer and Kramer—and iterated fast as a systems engineer. Reframing Hendrix as an engineer doesn’t diminish the art. It explains how one person, in under four years as a bandleader, could pull the electric guitar toward its full potential by systematically augmenting the instrument’s shortcomings for maximum expression.This article appears in the March 2026 print issue as “Jimi Hendrix, Systems Engineer.”",

Sign up now to get insider tips, expert advice, and practical strategies, written in partnership with tech career development company Parsity and delivered to your inbox for free!Standing Out as a Remote Worker Takes a Different StrategyMy first experience as a remote worker was a disaster.Before I joined a San Francisco-based team with a lead developer in Connecticut, I had worked in person, five days a week. I thought success was simple: write good code, solve hard problems, deliver results. So I put my head down and worked harder than ever.Twelve-hour days became normal as the boundary between work and personal life disappeared. My kitchen table became my office.I rarely asked for help because I didn’t want to seem incompetent. I stayed quiet in team Slack channels because I wasn’t sure what to say.Despite working some of the longest hours of my career, I made the slowest progress. I felt disconnected from the team. I had no idea if my work mattered or if anyone noticed what I was doing. I was burning out.Eventually, I realized the real problem: I was invisible.The Office Advantage You Lose When RemoteIn an office, visibility happens naturally. Colleagues see you arrive early or stay late. They notice when you are stuck on a problem. They hear about your work in hallway conversations and over lunch. Physical presence creates recognition with almost no effort.Remote work removes those signals. Your manager cannot see you at your desk. Your teammates don’t know you’ve hit a roadblock unless you say so. You can work long days and still appear less engaged than someone in the office.That is the shift many people miss: Remote work requires execution plus deliberate communication.What Actually WorksBy my second remote role, I knew I had to change to protect my sanity and still succeed.Here are five things I did that made a real difference.1. Over-communicatingI began sharing updates in team channels regularly, not just when asked. “Working on the payment integration today; ready for review tomorrow.” “Hit a blocker with API rate limits; investigating options.” These took seconds but made my work visible and invited help sooner.2. Setting limitsWhen your home is also your office, overwork becomes the default. I started ending most days at 5 p.m. and transitioning out of work mode with a walk or gym session. That ritual helped prevent burnout.3. Volunteering for presentationsPresenting remotely felt less intimidating than standing in front of a room. I started volunteering for demos and lunch-and-learns. This increased my visibility beyond my immediate team and improved my communication skills.4. Promoting others publiclyWhen someone helped me, I thanked them in a public channel. When a teammate shipped something impressive, I called it out. This builds goodwill and signals collaboration. In remote environments, gratitude is visible and memorable.5. Building relationships deliberatelyIn an office, relationships form naturally. Remotely, you have to create those moments. I started an engineering book club that met every other week to discuss a technical book. It became a low-pressure way to connect with people across the organization.The Counterintuitive RealityWith these habits, I got promoted faster in this remote job than I ever did in an office. I moved from senior engineer to engineering manager in under two years, while maintaining a better work-life balance.Remote work offers flexibility and freedom, but it comes with a tax. You are easier to overlook and more likely to burn out unless you are intentional in your actions.So, succeeding remotely takes deliberate effort in communication, relationships, and boundaries. If you do that well, remote work can unlock more opportunities than you might expect.—BrianThis Former Physicist Helps Keep the Internet SecureDespite its critical role in maintaining a secure network, authentication software often goes unnoticed by users.

        "title": "AI Is Acing Math Exams Faster Than Scientists Write Them",
        "text": "Mathematics is often regarded as the ideal domain for measuring AI progress effectively. Math’s step-by-step logic is easy to track, and its definitive automatically verifiable answers remove any human or subjective factors. But AI systems are improving at such a pace that math benchmarks are struggling to keep up.Way back in November 2024, non-profit research organization Epoch AI quietly released FrontierMath. A standardized, rigorous benchmark, Frontier Math was designed to measure the mathematical reasoning capabilities of the latest AI tools.“It’s a bunch of really hard math problems,” explains Greg Burnham, Epoch AI Senior Researcher. “Originally, it was 300 problems that we now call tiers 1–3, but having seen AI capabilities really speed up, there was a feeling that we had to run to stay ahead, so now there’s a special challenge set of extra carefully constructed problems that we call tier 4.”To a rough approximation, tiers 1–4 go from advanced undergraduate through to early postdoc level mathematics. When introduced, state-of-the-art AI models were unable to solve more than 2% of the problems FrontierMath contained. Fast forward to today and the best publicly available AI models, such as GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.6, are solving over 40% of FrontierMath’s 300 tiers 1–3 problems, and over 30% of the 50 tier 4 problems.AI takes on PhD level mathematicsAnd this dizzying pace of advancement is showing no signs of abating. For example, just recently Google DeepMind announced that Aletheia, an experimental AI system derived from Gemini Deep Think, achieved publishable PhD level research results. Though obscure mathematically—calculating certain structure constants in arithmetic geometry called eigenweights—the result is significant in terms of AI development.“They’re claiming it was essentially autonomous, meaning a human wasn’t guiding the work, and it’s publishable,” Burnham says. “It’s definitely at the lower end of the spectrum of work that would get a mathematician excited, but it’s new—it’s something we truly haven’t really seen before.”To place this achievement in context, every FrontierMath problem has a known answer that a human has derived. Though a human could probably have achieved Aletheia’s result “if they sat down and steeled themselves for a week,” says Burnham, no human had ever done so.Aletheia’s results and other recent achievements by AI mathematicians point to new, tougher benchmarks being needed to understand AI capabilities, and fast, because existing ones will soon become irrelevant. “There are easier math benchmarks that are already obsolete, several generations of them,” says Burnham. “FrontierMath will probably saturate [meaning state-of-the-art AI models score 100%] within the next two years; could be faster.”The First Proof challengeTo begin to address this problem, on February 6, a group of 11 highly distinguished mathematicians proposed the First Proof challenge, a set of 10 extremely difficult math questions which arose naturally in the authors’ research processes, and whose proofs are roughly five pages or less and had not been shared with anyone. The First Proof challenge was a preliminary effort to assess the capabilities of AI systems in solving research-level math questions on their own.Generating serious buzz in the math community, professional and amateur mathematicians, and teams including OpenAI, all stepped up to the challenge. But by the time the authors posted the proofs on February 14, no one had submitted correct solutions to all 10 problems.In fact, far from it. The authors themselves only solved two of the 10 problems using Gemini 3.0 Deep Think and ChatGPT 5.2 Pro. And most outside submissions fared little better, apart from OpenAI and a small Aletheia team at Google DeepMind. With “limited human supervision” OpenAI’s most advanced internal AI system solved five of the 10 problems, with Aletheia achieving similar outcomes—results met with a spectrum of emotions by different members of the mathematics community, from awe to disappointment. The team behind First Proof plans an even tougher second round on March 14.A new frontier for AI“I think First Proof is terrific: it’s as close as you could realistically get to putting an AI system in the shoes of a mathematician,” says Burnham. Though he admires how First Proof tests AI’s mathematical utility for a wide range of mathematics and mathematicians, Epoch AI has its own new approach to testing—FrontierMath: Open Problems. Uniquely, the pilot benchmark consists of 16 open problems (with more to follow) from research mathematics that professional mathematicians have tried and failed to solve. Since Open Problems’ release on January 27, none have been solved by an AI.“With Open Problems, we’ve tried to make it more challenging,” says Burnham. “The baseline on its own would be publishable, at least in a specialty journal.” What’s more, each question is designed so that it can be automatically graded. “This is a bit counterintuitive,” Burnham adds. “No one knows the answers, but we have a computer program that will be able to judge whether the answer is right or not.”Burnham sees First Proof and Open Problems as being complementary. “I would say understanding AI capabilities is a more-the-merrier situation,” he adds. “AI has gotten to the point where it’s, in some ways, better than most PhD students, so we need to pose problems where the answer would be at least moderately interesting to some human mathematicians, not because AI was doing it, but because it’s mathematics that human mathematicians care about.”",
