        "text": "Name: Nike Rejuven8 Run \"Rust Factor\"Colorway: Black/Rust Factor-MuslinSKU: IO9932-001MSRP: $135 USDRelease Date: 2026Where to Buy: NikeNike is injecting fresh energy into its recovery footwear lineup by reviving a forgotten gem from the late 2000s. The Nike Rejuven8 Run, originally introduced during the 2008 Beijing Olympics as a breathable, post-performance solution, is making a comeback with a modern twist. The new \"Rust Factor\" edition reimagines the silhouette for 2026, positioning it not just as a recovery tool, but as a versatile lifestyle option for women who prioritize both comfort and style.The defining characteristic of the Rejuven8 Run is its modular construction. The shoe features a lightweight, cage-like outer shell designed for maximum airflow and support. Inside, a removable mesh bootie provides a sock-like fit. This \"Rust Factor\" release leans heavily into versatility, offering two interchangeable inner booties: a vibrant red option that coordinates with the shoe's \"Rust Factor\" accents, and a classic black option for a more understated aesthetic.While the original model was purely functional, the 2026 iteration embraces current fashion trends. The outer shell is treated with a gradient finish, transitioning from deep black to lighter hues, giving the shoe a dynamic, fluid appearance. The \"Rust Factor\" colorway combines Black, Rust Factor, and Muslin, creating an earthy yet bold palette that fits seamlessly into contemporary wardrobes. The revival aligns with the broader trend of \"gorpcore\" and technical footwear moving into the fashion mainstream.The Nike Rejuven8 Run \"Rust Factor\" is expected to release soon.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "SummaryJOOPITER has announced a special three-way collaboration featuring Jacob &amp; Co. and NIGO's HUMAN MADEThe release transforms HUMAN MADE's iconic heart motif into a refined, everyday wearable pendantThe piece serves as a tribute to Jacob Arabo, who famously introduced Pharrell Williams and NIGO in the early 2000sStreetwear and high jewelry are colliding once again in a celebration of cultural history. JOOPITER, the digital auction house founded by Pharrell Williams, has unveiled a limited-edition Jacob &amp; Co. x HUMAN MADE Heart Pendant. Priced at $1,400 USD, the piece takes NIGO's recognizable HUMAN MADE heart logo and elevates it through Jacob &amp; Co.'s signature craftsmanship. Beyond the brilliant finish, the pendant serves as a wearable monument to a 30-year friendship that fundamentally reshaped the worlds of fashion, music, and luxury.The story behind the pendant dates back to the turn of the millennium. Before Billionaire Boys Club or ICECREAM existed, NIGO was already an admirer of Pharrell's boundary-pushing jewelry. NIGO would frequently visit Jacob Arabo, bringing photos of Pharrell's custom pieces and commissioning his own versions in different shades of gold. Recognizing the striking synchronicity in their tastes and creative energy, Jacob arranged an introduction between the two visionaries. That single meeting sparked a lifelong friendship and a creative alliance that brought BAPE to the U.S. and laid the blueprint for the modern luxury-streetwear crossover.The release of this collaborative pendant coincides with JOOPITER’s latest high-profile auction, Objects of Brilliance: From the Collection of Pharrell Williams and Jacob Arabo. Running from February 17 through March 5, the auction features 30 extraordinary lots spanning three decades of Pharrell and Jacob's partnership. While the auction itself includes multi-million dollar, one-of-a-kind pieces (including a lavish diamond-and-ruby version of the HUMAN MADE heart that converts into a brooch), this $1,400 USD pendant offers fans a more accessible way to own a piece of this historic partnership.The limited-edition Jacob &amp; Co. x HUMAN MADE x JOOPITER Heart Pendant releases on February 18 at 9 p.m. EST. It will be available for a limited time across three platforms including JOOPITER, HUMANMADE and Jacob &amp; Co.

        "title": "For Kody Phillips, Minimalism Means Intentionality",
        "text": "We recently went “Behind the Design” with Kody Phillips’ eponymous label to spotlight the designer’s partnership with Intuit TurboTax. The partnership demonstrates the intersection of business and art and how modern resources, like TurboTax, unlock greater accessibility to financial literacy, empowering  business owners, like Kody Phillips, to turn their creative visions into real, tangible assets. The lookbook is set at a kitchen table — a tribute to both the designer’s humble beginnings and the entrepreneurial spirit of TurboTax, and its parent company Intuit, which began with the simple goal to help families sitting around their own tables, trying to balance their finances. Kody Phillip’s latest five-piece collection is finally here, and it’s a window into Phillip’s identity, with every fine detail being a testament to his committed demeanor which anchors unique creative artistry.Designed as everyday streetwear, the capsule’s theme centers on workwear silhouettes that are subtly distressed and splattered with paint — a nod to the garments he and his team universally don in the studio. Staying true to his brand’s penchant for utilitarian designs, the collection reimagines the modern pant suit, swapping in textured denim and and embellished jacket as the new corporate uniform for creatives braving the chaos of the city. Additionally, the collection includes an all-new camp collar shirt design, a signature beret cap, and an everyday T-shirt featuring a stylized airbrushed “Kody Phillips” logo with a subtle nod to the TurboTax checkball.[-]Phillips’ latest camp shirt design is an essential. A breezy, relaxed shirt tailored to perfection, its effortless drape on the body emphasized by intricate braided piping and custom jewels embellishing the lapels. The two-tone piping continues down the silhouette with subtle accents appearing at the front chest pocket. Red and watermelon gems and iridescent pearls bring a touch of understated charm and personality to the otherwise structured silhouette.The Lasso Cap is the finishing touch to the capsule. This three-tiered peak silhouette features contrast piping and striking “KP” embroidery, tying the collection’s theme into a unified vision. Running a business requires discipline, but it’s clear Kody Phillips enjoys defining his style with the minute details.For this project, Phillips was excited to debut custom-designed hardware, a bespoke garment clasp that’s been in development for the past few years. With final samples in hand, oversized “KP” antique-toned clasps add a statement-making touch to the off-white cotton jacket, featuring wide lapels and front panel pockets with matching zipper hardware. The designer’s love of exaggerated denim shines through with matching wide-leg cotton pants.Each garment is finished with a custom label that is dedicated to the cross streets of Broadway and Grand in NYC, where the clothing first debuted at TurboTax’s new state-of-the-art flagship store, with local tax experts offering a completely done-for-you tax filing experience, now in-person. Browse the full collection in the galleries above, and head to Kody Phillips' website to see more from the brand.Read more at Hypebeast",

        "title": "Lana Del Rey Returns With Her \"Favorite Song\" From 'Stove'",
        "text": "Lana Del Rey's new era just might be upon us...The lead single lifted from her long-awaited new studio project, Stove, has materialized at last. Entitled \"White Feather Hawk Tail Deer Hunter,\" the track is a true family affair, written by Del Rey herself, of course, alongside her sister Chuck Grant, her brother-in-law Jason Pickens, and her husband Jeremy Dufrene. Dufrene is a big topic of discussion on the four-minute cut, which also features production contributions from Jack Antonoff, strings from Drew Erickson, and additional mixing from Dean Reid and Laura Sisk.Stove, at first, was slated to signal a sonic shift for Del Rey, marking a foray into a more country composition. However, \"White Feather Hawk Tail Deer Hunter\" is nothing twangy at all; rather, it relishes in a psychedelic, orchestral whimsy. It's more of a magical musing on her now-married life, bolstered by sparse instrumental arrangements and breathy lyricism.To backtrack, the songstress has soft-launched her tenth studio album a couple of times thus far. Initially, the Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd follow-up was entitled Lasso, and scheduled for a September 2024 release. Needless to say, the September date came and went, and was shifted to May 2025, with new title The Right Person Will Stay. Once again, the intended release date is in the rearview, the LP once again boasting a new name of Stove and now void of a confirmed drop date.“I know, you’re asking about the record, but honestly, soon because vinyl takes three months, so you have three months plus two weeks…it could be give or take a little bit less than that. But aside from that, I really want you to focus on this single,\" she wrote on her Instagram story yesterday.  In another post, she referred to \"White Feather Hawk Tail Deer Hunter\" as her \"favorite song\" lifted from the album.Stream \"White Feather Hawk Tail Deer Hunter\" out everywhere now, and stay tuned as more information transpires on Stove – if that's still the name of the project, that is...Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "title": "14 Film Visionaries Go Off Script in the Lucid Gravity Frunk Seat",
        "text": "In a performance unlike any other automotive presentation before, Lucid recently debuted the new all-electric Gravity in its orchestral Seven Suite showcase. Taking place at Berlin’s Tempodrom, it invited 14 film visionaries to experience the showcase directly from the car’s defining front trunk.With the SUVs positioned around the orchestral ensemble, this unique frunk compartment – which opens up to provide a two-person seat – played a starring role in the performance. Striking a bold statement with a roomy space, the installation revealed how the car can be enjoyed for moments of entertainment, observation and, more importantly, thought-provoking conversation.Exploring the frunk’s infinite possibilities, Hypebeast connected the featuring collective of film stars, directors and screenwriters for discussion on their own creative journeys. Inspired by Uèle Lamore’s cinematic scores, they touch on the nuances of performance and emotion in film, finding synergy between the screen and Lucid Gravity’s pioneering design sensibilities. “Emotion comes as the first step, not the end result,” begins cinematographer Christopher Aoun in profound thought. Sitting beside Emmy-nominated actor Jannis Niewöhner, he touches on feeling as an integral part of the filmmaking process, leading him to craft polarizing scenes in films including All That’s Left in You. He adds, “I’m fed by uncertainty - whether things are going to be good or not – it's about taking the time to trust the people I work with.”While Aoun has grown to have more faith in his cast, globally celebrated actor and Cannes Best Actress winner Diane Kruger looks inward when working on a project, sharing, “You discover the vision that the director has, then you make it your own and try to create something that is in your mind.” For Alexander Fehling, best known for his role as Master Sgt. Wilhelm in Inglourious Basterds, he shares this process of reflection that starts with “losing yourself in the material,” whereas emerging actor Gustav Schmidt resorts to research, mentioning, “You have to dig into portraying a role.”Meeting for the first time in the frunk are British-German actor Langston Uibel and Polish-French director Wero Rodowicz. After finding out how they’ve individually carved out spaces in the German film industry, they came to the conclusion that the success of any film is down to nurturing the experiences of those on set. Rodowicz says it's about “taking care of people’s poetic gardens and thinking how we can contribute to them,” to which Uibel replies, “It’s nice to know you have your group of people that you want to learn from.” In the same way that the Lucid Gravity brings you closer to new communities, “the magic of cinema,” as explained by Schmidt, “is in the power of connecting people from different places.” And, while the effects of a film are often considered from the audience’s perspective, Dutch actor Gaite Jansen reflects on what it feels like to be an actor in front of the camera. “Through searching for those places where things get exciting, dangerous, and you lose control, that’s when you find out what it feels like to be human,” she says. “I enjoy life a little bit more because I’m allowing myself to feel everything.”From trusting the journey to stepping outside your comfort zone, the conversations between fellow film visionaries show that there is more than one parallel to be drawn from the seven-seater SUV and the silver screen. But, as Rodowicz puts it, the two worlds are ultimately born from “creating spaces where you can slow down for a moment and access your feelings.” View this post on InstagramA post shared by HYPEBEAST (@hypebeast) Be sure to explore the Lucid Gravity on the brand’s website now.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "title": "As political pressure prompts exodus of Minnesota prosecutors, some defendants catch a break",
        "text": "Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, center, answers questions during a news conference at the Minneapolis federal courthouse, Wednesday, March 19, 2025, after a jury found the alleged ringleader of a massive pandemic fraud case guilty on all counts. (Kerem Yücel/Minnesota Public Radio via AP, File)2026-02-19T05:08:03Z\n                                        MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The federal prosecutor’s office in Minnesota has been gutted by a wave of career officials resigning or retiring over objections to Trump administration directives. Because of the turmoil, 12-time convicted felon Cory Allen McKay caught a break.With a three-decade record of violent crime that includes strangling a pregnant woman and firing a shotgun under a person’s chin, McKay was scheduled to stand trial next month on methamphetamine trafficking charges that could have locked him up for 25 years. Instead, he walked free after the prosecutor on his case retired.The Trump administration says its aggressive immigration enforcement in Minnesota has improved public safety. Left in its wake, though, is a greatly weakened U.S. Attorney’s Office, where many prosecutors resented the way Trump’s political appointees at the Justice Department managed them.\n    \n        \n    \n\nOffices in other states, from New York to Virginia, have also been hit by resignations as prosecutors object to what they see as the politicization of decision-making under Trump. But Minnesota has been hit especially hard.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nA growing number of defendants like McKay are beginning to escape accountability, as the remaining prosecutors are forced to dismiss some cases, kill others before charges are filed and seek plea agreements and delays.Local officials worry the office will be unable, at least temporarily, to bring charges against some of the state’s most serious offenders.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“The result will be a diminished ability to target dangerous fraudsters, sexual predators, violent gangs and drug traffickers,” said John Marti, a Minneapolis lawyer who was a longtime fraud prosecutor in the office until 2015.After asking for a delay to find someone to take McKay’s case, the office led by Trump appointee Daniel Rosen dropped it so abruptly McKay’s lawyer didn’t learn about the move until after her client had been released.“This was completely surprising to me,” said McKay’s lawyer, Jean Brandl. While she hasn’t been able to reach him, “I can guarantee you he’s happy about it.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nAn exodus of prosecutorsOver the past year, the number of assistant U.S. attorneys in Minnesota has fallen from more than 40 prosecutors before Trump retook office to fewer than two dozen. That’s according to a former federal prosecutor who wasn’t authorized to discuss personnel matters and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.The exodus began last year as several prosecutors “saw the writing on the wall” that their jobs — and the government’s definition of justice — were going to be different under the new administration, the former federal prosecutor said.It accelerated after Trump appointees in the Justice Department intervened to block a joint state-federal investigation into the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of Renee Good by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross. While Trump officials called Good a “domestic terrorist” and argued Ross fired in self-defense, some in the office viewed the killing as a potential murder.\n    \n        \n    \n\nCareer prosecutors also objected to directives that they divert much of their resources to immigration cases, and they chafed at repeated violations of court orders by ICE that angered judges.\n    \n    Have a news tip?Contact AP’s global investigative team at [email&#160;protected].

Thompson was a Justice Department veteran known for high-profile fraud investigations. He and Jacobs had helped uncover the $300 million Feeding Our Future scheme in which more than 75 defendants have been charged with defrauding a COVID-19-era child nutrition program.Each time an experienced attorney leaves, leaders assess that prosecutor’s caseload and make decisions about how many of their cases can be reassigned to remaining staff and which will be dropped due to diminished resources.\n    \n        \n    \n\nCourt records show the office has been operating in crisis mode, bringing in prosecutors from other states, asking judges to delay hearings, and trying to make some cases go away through dismissals and plea agreements. Defense lawyers are seeking to capitalize by demanding speedy trials for clients and filing other motions that require responses from prosecutors.The Justice Department and the U.S. Attorney’s Office did not respond to requests for comment. The office’s former spokesperson, prosecutor Melinda Williams, was among those who left.\n    \n        \n    \n\nDrug trafficking cases dismissedMcKay, 47, isn’t the only drug trafficking defendant to benefit.The office last month also dropped a case against a man who was arrested in September after investigators said they found him in possession of a stash of drugs set to be trafficked in the Twin Cities that included 7,600 fentanyl pills and 15 pounds of cocaine. A third dismissed case involved a man who was charged with conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine after police in Rochester found three pounds of the drug in a search of his vehicle in January 2025.“With everybody leaving there, it’s presenting some challenges for everyone around the state,” said Clay County Sheriff Mark Empting, who said McKay would present “a big public safety concern” if he returns to Moorhead. “Hopefully they are going to rebuild the office and take these cases on again.”10 pounds of highly pure methThe case against McKay dated to 2024, when FedEx employees in Fargo, North Dakota, discovered a package containing nearly 10 pounds of highly pure meth arriving from California and addressed to McKay. Police estimated the street value at $80,000.A detective posing as a FedEx employee delivered the package to McKay, who was arrested. Investigators say they searched cellphones, and found text messages linking McKay to other suspected drug traffickers in Minnesota, California, Chicago and Mexico.McKay was jailed for nearly a year awaiting trial on state charges, before a federal grand jury returned an indictment in May 2025 charging him with two methamphetamine distribution charges. The indictment included a sentencing enhancement because he had more than two prior violent felonies.Those include aggravated assault in 2013, domestic assault by strangulation in 2017 and assault causing substantial bodily harm in 2021. Prosecutors said he had at least a dozen felony convictions, dating to when he was 16 and fired a short-barreled shotgun under the chin of a victim.An offender jailed, then set freeLongtime assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Hollenhorst argued last summer that McKay was too dangerous to be released before trial, even to a substance abuse program, saying his history of violence would “put countless people at risk.”A judge agreed, noting McKay had repeatedly failed to show up for court proceedings, given police false names and had his probation revoked for violations.But last month, the U.S. Attorney’s Office noted that Hollenhorst was “retiring unexpectedly” and asked for a delay. A judge moved the trial date from Feb. 12 to March 2. The office still dropped the case days later in a filing that offered no explanation. A judge ordered McKay’s immediate release. Hollenhorst declined comment.On Jan. 31, McKay walked out of the Sherburne County Jail in Elk River, 30 miles outside Minneapolis. Attempts by AP to reach him were unsuccessful. Brandl, McKay’s lawyer, said that while the outcome was a victory for her client, Hollenhorst’s retirement after 40 years with the Justice Department was “a huge loss.”“He was a very good prosecutor,” she said. “He was reasonable and saw our clients as human beings, not just numbers.”___Foley reported from Iowa City, Iowa. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                RYAN J.

        "title": "Jesse Jackson’s 1988 presidential run inspired generations to carry his message",
        "text": "Jesse Jackson, with his wife Jacqueline, concedes defeat in the Illinois Democratic primary on March 16, 1988, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Lisa Genesen, File)2026-02-18T17:52:18Z\n                                        When the Rev. Jesse Jackson announced his second presidential bid in 1988 in Pittsburgh, he saw the campaign as a chance for the country to realize its highest ideals.“If I can become president,” said Jackson, who grew up poor and Black in segregated South Carolina, “every woman can. Every man can. I’m giving America a chance to make a choice to fulfill the highest and best of an authentic and honest democracy.”While unsuccessful, the campaign captured the imaginations of countless Americans who were inspired by Jackson, who died Tuesday at 84.Decades later, generations of young people who watched his historic campaigns or learned about his career have become veteran activists, clergy members, civic leaders and lawmakers. Many say that his unapologetic message of equality and justice informs their work today.“Here I was, a kid growing up in public housing, and I got to witness this Black man running for president. He gave me a glimpse of what is possible, and he taught me how to say, ‘I am somebody’,” said Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia, referring to one of Jackson’s slogans adopted from a poem.\n    \n        \n    \n\nWarnock also serves as the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, the congregation once led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The Georgia Democrat said Jackson’s example was “needed now more than ever” in response to the Trump administration’s actions on elections, global affairs and immigration.“His voice is now silent, but his example is eternal, and that work is left to us,” Warnock said.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nA life of advocacyJackson’s life included work as a globe-trotting humanitarian, a champion for a progressive economic agenda and leadership of the Civil Rights Movement that was once led by King, Jackson’s mentor. Jackson was present when King was assassinated at a Memphis hotel.Jackson’s 1988 presidential bid pushed many Americans to contemplate whether, two decades after King’s killing, one of his protégés could be elected to the White House. His message of equality in the Democratic primary resonated with a broad set of voters and blindsided party leaders, who reformed the primary system in response to the surge of engagement.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nStrategists credit those reforms with enabling the election of another Black candidate from Illinois to the presidency two decades later.\n    \n        \n    \n\nBarack Obama agreed in a statement praising Jackson’s life.Former first lady Michelle Obama “got her first glimpse of political organizing at the Jacksons’ kitchen table when she was a teenager,” Obama wrote. “And in his two historic runs for president, he laid the foundation for my own campaign to the highest office in the land.”The connection did not stop Jackson from criticizing Obama or mentoring activists who challenged the first Black president’s administration.“He continued to reach out to young Black activists throughout the protests that started in 2014,” said DeRay McKesson, a racial justice activist who organized in Ferguson, Missouri, as part of the Black Lives Matter movement. “As an activist and organizer, I appreciate that Jesse, just like the generation of people he came up with, had a deep understanding of structural change.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nJackson remained a political force after his presidential bids. From the Chicago headquarters of his organization, the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, he mentored leaders for decades. After his death, scores of activists, political operatives and members of Congress credited their careers to Jackson.Democratic Rep. Troy Carter of Louisiana was a young staffer to New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy when he first met Jackson.“Over the years, since our first meeting, he encouraged me in every step of my political career. His legacy will endure in every life he inspired,” Carter said.Former Vice President Kamala Harris eulogized Jackson in a statement that remembered how his 1988 presidential run built a sense of community among supporters. When she was a law student in San Francisco, she recalled, people “from every walk of life would give me a thumbs-up or honk of support” upon seeing her car’s “Jesse Jackson for President” bumper sticker.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“They were small interactions, but they exemplified Reverend Jackson’s life work — lifting up the dignity of working people, building community and coalitions, and strengthening our democracy and nation,” wrote Harris, who went on to become the first Black woman to be nominated by a major political party for president.Even people with opposing views acknowledged Jackson’s impact as a civil rights giant and a stalwart force for progressive, humanitarian values.“I don’t have to agree with someone politically to deeply respect the role Jesse Jackson, a South Carolina native, played in uplifting Black voices and inspiring young folks to believe their voices mattered,” Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the lone Black Republican in the Senate, wrote on social media. “Those that empower people to stand taller always leave a lasting mark.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nA mentor to a new generationTennessee state Rep. Justin Pearson was 8 years old when he first learned about Jackson from a picture book on Black history that his mother gave him. Jackson’s face was on the cover.Pearson, 31, thanked Jackson for “creating space for people like me to be where I am.” He met Jackson after Republicans expelled him and another Black Democratic lawmaker after they joined a protest for gun control at the Tennessee Statehouse.Pearson, who represents Memphis in the statehouse, later joined Jackson on a trip to lay a wreath at the site where King was killed. Pearson has appeared alongside Jackson at other civil rights events throughout the South. Even at memorials filled with towering figures, he said, Jackson stood out.“You have a lot of civil rights elders who you read about, but it means something different when you have somebody who you can talk to, who can be present, who is there physically,” said Tennessee state Rep. Justin Jones, the other lawmaker who met Jackson after being expelled. Both men were later reelected to their seats.Jackson “was committed to raising the rising generation of civil rights voices and leaders and legislators, and somebody who has a whole movement that is standing on his shoulders,” said Jones, 30.Stacey Abrams was 10 years old in Gulfport, Mississippi, during Jackson’s first presidential bid. The daughter of ministers, Abrams remembers being “transfixed” by a “larger than life figure who did not look like everyone else.”Now a former minority leader of the Georgia House, Abrams mounted two unsuccessful bids for governor. Each time, she sought to rally a wide range of voters, including voters of color and lower-income voters, in a strategy that emulated Jackson’s political philosophy. Jackson advised her throughout both bids.“I’ve been one of, I would say, thousands of people who received counsel and support from Jackson, but also got a phone call that said, ‘I’m thinking about you,’ or an offer to come and be a part of something he was doing,” Abrams said.“I think that’s the legacy that’s most important, that he didn’t stand as a single figure who wanted to be alone.

        "title": "New Jersey Catholic diocese agrees to $180 million settlement of clergy sexual abuse allegations",
        "text": "The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception is seen in Camden, N.J., April 20, 2022. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)2026-02-18T16:27:57Z\n                                        TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — A New Jersey Catholic diocese this week agreed to a $180 million settlement to resolve allegations of clergy sexual abuse, a figure far exceeding agreements in some large dioceses but still dwarfed by other massive settlements. Bishop Joseph Williams of the Diocese of Camden, covering southern New Jersey and its Philadelphia suburbs, announced the settlement Tuesday in a letter. “For the survivors of South Jersey, this day is long overdue and represents a milestone in their journey toward restored justice and the healing and recognition they have long sought and deserve,” Williams said. Mark Crawford, state director of the Survivors Network for those Abused by Priests, said in a phone interview Wednesday that the settlement was long overdue but he was glad the ordeal was coming to an end. He praised the bishop for listening to survivors and for pledging transparency, contrasting him with his predecessor, who fought a legal battle over a state investigation into alleged clergy abuse. \n    \n        \n    \n\n“This settlement and this bishop have acted very differently,” Crawford said. “I hope it sends a message that this is possible, that this is right.” \n\nGreg Gianforcaro, one of the attorneys representing victims suing the diocese, credited survivors’ persistence in reaching the agreement. The diocese has said there about 300 survivors of abuse raising claims. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“It’s been an extremely long and arduous battle,” he said in a phone interview. It’s the latest agreement in a scandal set off more than two decades ago when the scale of the abuse and the church’s effort to hide it came to light in Boston. The New Jersey settlement agreement is more than the roughly $80 million settlements in Boston and Philadelphia, though settlements in California ranged much higher. In 2024, the Los Angeles Archdiocese agreed to an $880 million payment. The Camden settlement comes less than a year after the diocese withdrew its objection to the state of New Jersey’s grand jury investigation into decades of alleged sexual abuse of children by religious. The state Supreme Court has since ruled the state’s investigation could move ahead. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe Camden diocese, like others nationwide, filed for bankruptcy amid a torrent of lawsuits after the statute of limitations was relaxed.In 2022, the diocese agreed to pay $87.5 million to settle allegations involving clergy sex abuse against some 300 accusers, one of the largest cash settlements involving the Catholic church in the U.S. The latest settlement announcement includes these funds, according to victims’ attorneys. The diocese of Camden covers six southern New Jersey counties outside Philadelphia. The agreement must still be approved by a bankruptcy court. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                MIKE CATALINI\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Catalini covers government, elections and news primarily in New Jersey for The Associated Press.

Last December, before prejudiced threats turned to bloodshed in the streets, they deployed this tasty east African staple – a fried, flaky, triangular-shaped pastry typically filled with ground meat, vegetables and spices (similar to south Asian samosas) – to combat the xenophobic rhetoric rapidly spreading across the Twin Cities. She estimates they bought and handed out hundreds of the simple snacks near community hubs, all in hopes of introducing others to the largest Somali diaspora community outside Africa.

        "text": "Gov. Kevin Stitt, R-Okla., chair of the National Governors Association (NGA), from left, Economic Club of Washington Chairman David Rubenstein, and Gov. Wes Moore, D-Md., vice chair of the NGA participate in a panel discussion during a conference at the Economic Club of Washington Wednesday, Feb. 18, 2026, in Washington. (AP Photo/Tom Brenner)2026-02-19T05:15:03Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — In another era, the scene would have been unremarkable. But in President Donald Trump’s Washington, it’s become increasingly rare.Sitting side by side on stage were Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat. They traded jokes and compliments instead of insults and accusations, a brief interlude of cordiality in a cacophony of conflict. Stitt and Moore are the leaders of the National Governors Association, one of a vanishing few bipartisan institutions left in American politics. But it may be hard for the organization, which is holding its annual conference this week, to maintain its reputation as a refuge from polarization. Trump has broken with custom by declining to invite all governors to the traditional White House meeting and dinner. He has called Stitt, the NGA’s chair, a “RINO,” short for Republican in name only, and continued to feud with Moore, the group’s vice chair, by blaming him for a sewage spill involving a federally regulated pipeline.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe break with tradition reflects Trump’s broader approach to his second term. He has taken a confrontational stance toward some states, withholding federal funds or deploying troops over the objections of local officials. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nWith the Republican-controlled Congress unwilling to limit Trump’s ambitions, several governors have increasingly cast themselves as a counterweight to the White House. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“Presidents aren’t supposed to do this stuff,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said about the expansion of executive power in recent administrations. “Congress needs to get their act together. And stop performing for TikTok and actually start doing stuff. That’s the flaw we’re dealing with right now.”Cox, a Republican, said “it is up to the states to hold the line.”Moore echoed that sentiment in an interview with The Associated Press.“People are paying attention to how governors are moving, because I think governors have a unique way to move in this moment that other people just don’t,” he said.\n    \n        \n    \n\nStill, governors struck an optimistic tone in panels and interviews Wednesday. Stitt said the conference is “bigger than one dinner at the White House.” Moore predicted “this is going to be a very productive three days for the governors.”“Here’s a Republican and Democrat governor from different states that literally agree on probably 80% of the things. And the things we disagree on we can have honest conversations on,” Stitt said while sitting beside Moore. Tensions over the guest list for White House events underscored the uncertainty surrounding the week. During the back-and-forth, Trump feuded with Stitt and said Moore and Colorado Gov. Jared Polis were not invited because they “are not worthy of being there.”Whether the bipartisan tone struck Wednesday evening can endure through the week — and beyond — remains an open question.“We can have disagreements. In business, I always want people around me arguing with me and pushing me because that’s where the best ideas come from,” said Stitt. “We need to all have these exchange of ideas.”\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JOEY CAPPELLETTI\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Cappelletti covers Congress for The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi)2026-02-18T16:39:09Z\n                                        JERUSALEM (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace is set to meet for the first time on Thursday in Washington, an early test of whether one of his marquee foreign policy initiatives can gain broad support and advance the shaky ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip.Trump’s ballooning ambitions for the board extend from governing and rebuilding Gaza as a futuristic metropolis to challenging the United Nations Security Council’s role in solving conflicts. But they could be tempered by the realities of dealing with Gaza, where there has so far been limited progress in achieving the narrower aims of the ceasefire.Palestinians, including many civilians, are still being killed in near-daily strikes that Israel says are aimed at militants who threaten or attack its forces. Hamas hasn’t disarmed, no international forces have deployed, and a Palestinian committee meant to take over from Hamas is stuck in neighboring Egypt.“If this meeting does not result in fast, tangible improvements on the ground — and particularly on the humanitarian front — its credibility will quickly crumble,” said Max Rodenbeck, Israel-Palestine Project Director at the International Crisis Group, a global think tank.\n    \n        \n    \n\nA new international bodyMore than two dozen nations have signed on as the board’s founding members. The list includes Israel and other regional heavyweights involved in ceasefire negotiations, as well as countries from outside the Middle East whose leaders support Trump or hope to gain his favor. U.S. allies like France, Norway and Sweden have so far declined.Israelis are suspicious of the involvement of Qatar and Turkey, which have longstanding relations with Hamas. Palestinians object because their representatives weren’t invited to the board, even as it weighs the future of a territory that is home to some 2 million of them.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nTrump, the self-appointed chairman of the board, said earlier this week that member countries had pledged $5 billion toward rebuilding Gaza and would commit thousands of personnel to peacekeeping and policing. No financial pledges — or an agenda for this week’s meeting — have been made public.“We want to make it successful. I think it has the chance to be the most consequential board ever assembled of any kind,” Trump told reporters on Monday. He reiterated his criticism of the U.N.'s record on resolving international disputes.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nAmbitious plansTrump — along with son-in-law Jared Kushner and envoy Steve Witkoff — has laid out ambitious plans for rebuilding Gaza with international investment.In Davos last month, Kushner suggested reconstruction could be complete in a matter of three years, even though U.N. forecasts suggest that clearing rubble and demining alone could take much longer.Kushner’s slides showed a reconstructed Gaza with a coastal tourism strip, industrial zones and data centers. He conceded that rebuilding would begin only in demilitarized areas and that security would be essential to attract investment.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe latest joint estimate by the U.N., European Union and World Bank says reconstruction will cost about $70 billion.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said there will be no reconstruction until Hamas disarms, leaving Palestinians in limbo among the widespread devastation. \n    \n        \n    \n\nHalting progressThe ceasefire deal has halted major military operations, freed the last hostages held by Hamas and ramped up aid deliveries to Gaza. But a lasting resolution to the two-year war ignited by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel remains elusive.The deal envisions Hamas handing over its weapons and Israeli forces withdrawing from Gaza as international forces deploy. It left some questions unanswered and set no timeline to secure buy-in and defer confrontation over those issues.Israel and the U.S. say Hamas’ disarmament is key to progress on the other fronts. Arab and Muslim members of the Board of Peace have accused Israel of undermining the ceasefire with its daily strikes and want the U.S. to rein in its close ally. They have called on Hamas to disarm but say Israel’s withdrawal is just as important.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIsrael defines demilitarization as extending from heavy weapons like rocket-propelled grenades all the way down to rifles. Netanyahu said Sunday that Hamas would have to give up roughly 60,000 automatic rifles.Despite accepting the agreement, Hamas has made only vague or conditional commitments to disarm as part of a process leading to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Senior Hamas officials have said their security forces need to retain some weapons in order to maintain law and order during the transition.Some of the ideas under discussion include Hamas “freezing” its arms by placing them in sealed depots under outside supervision or giving up heavy weapons while keeping some handguns for policing, according to two regional officials involved in the negotiations. One official said disarmament is a complicated process that could take months. The officials requested anonymity to discuss the negotiations.It’s far from certain that Israel or the United States would agree to such ideas.\n    \n        \n    \n\nA stabilization forceThe ceasefire deal also calls for a temporary International Stabilization Force made up of soldiers from Arab and Muslim-majority countries to vet, train and support to a new Palestinian police force. Its mandate is not spelled out in detail, but would include securing aid deliveries and preventing weapons smuggling.Countries being asked to contribute to the force insist that any deployment be framed as a peacekeeping mission. They have refused to take part in the disarmament of Hamas, a job that could put them in harm’s way. Another concern is the presence of armed groups allied with Israel.Indonesia has begun training a contingent of up to 8,000 soldiers for the force, though its foreign minister said last week that they would not take part in disarmament.Postwar governanceUnder the ceasefire agreement, Hamas is to hand over power to a transitional committee of politically independent Palestinian administrators. The U.S. has named a 15-member committee and tapped former U.N. envoy Nickolay Mladenov to oversee them as the board’s envoy to Gaza.The committee, led by former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath, has not yet been granted Israeli permission to enter Gaza from Egypt. Israel hasn’t commented on the matter. Mladenov said last week that the committee will not be able to work unless Hamas hands over power and ceasefire violations stop.“We’re only embarrassing the committee and ultimately making it ineffective,” he said at the Munich Security Conference. “All of this needs to move very fast.”__ Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "title": "Transportation Department says more than 550 driving schools should close over safety failures",
        "text": "Freight trucks travel northbound on Interstate 5 Highway, Sept. 3, 2025, in Tracy, Calif. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. Vásquez, File)2026-02-18T19:57:42Z\n                                        More than 550 commercial driving schools in the U.S. that train truckers and bus drivers must close after investigators found they employed unqualified instructors, failed to adequately test students and had other safety issues, the federal Transportation Department planned to announce Wednesday.The move marks the Transportation Department’s latest effort to improve safety in the trucking industry. And unlike its previous actions last fall to decertify up to 7,500 schools that included many defunct operations, this latest step is focused on what it deemed were active schools with significant shortcomings that inspectors identified in 1,426 site visits. The department has been aggressively going after states that handed out commercial driver’s licenses to immigrants who shouldn’t have qualified for them ever since a fatal crash in August. A truck driver that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. Other fatal crashes since then, including one in Indiana earlier this month that killed four, have only added to the concerns. \n    \n        \n    \n\nDuffy said 448 schools that failed to meet basic safety standards. Inspectors found shortcomings such as employing unqualified instructors, failing to test students’ skills or teach them how to handle hazardous materials and using the wrong equipment to teach drivers. Another 109 schools removed themselves from the registry of schools when they learned that inspectors were planning to visit.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n“American families should have confidence that our school bus and truck drivers are following every letter of the law and that starts with receiving proper training before getting behind the wheel,” Duffy said. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe list of schools that officials want to decertify now are generally smaller ones, including a number of programs run by school districts. The bigger, more reputable schools were generally not included in this action. Another 97 schools are currently under investigation for compliance issues.\n    \n        \n    \n\nPart of the problem in the trucking industry is that schools and trucking companies can essentially self certify themselves when they apply to begin operating, observers note, and questionable operations might not be caught until much later when the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration gets a chance to audit them.It wasn’t immediately clear how many students were enrolled at these schools that are being decertified. But there is some cushion in the industry right now because there are currently more drivers than needed in the midst of a 10% drop in shipments since 2022 because of the economic uncertainty. Although many trucking companies still struggle to find enough well-qualified drivers with clean records.In addition to threatening to withhold federal funding from states that don’t clean up their commercial driver’s license programs, the Trump Administration has been focused on making sure truck drivers meet English proficiency standards. California is the only state to lose funding so far with the federal government planning to withhold $160 million.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JOSH FUNK\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Funk is an Associated Press reporter who covers transportation including aviation safety and airlines along with all the major freight railroads.

A plaque is a toxic environment that draws in macrophage cells that attempt to repair the lesion, but instead are overwhelmed, killed, and add their mass to the plaque. Initially, circulating monocyte cells arrive at a plaque and turn into macrophages, but in later stages an almost cancerous process causes smooth muscle cells in the vascular wall to [&#8230;]",

Allen’s estate announced Wednesday that it has begun the process of selling the team, which is just coming off its second Super Bowl victory in franchise history. Investment bank Allen &amp; Company and law firm Latham &amp; Watkins will lead the sales process, which is estimated to continue through the offseason. NFL owners must then ratify a final purchase agreement.The estate said the sale is consistent with Allen’s directive to eventually sell his sports holdings and direct all estate proceeds to philanthropy.The Seahawks have been in the Allen family since 1997, when Paul bought the Seahawks for $194 million from then-owner Ken Behring.Since Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, died in 2018 from complications of non-Hodgkin lymphoma at 65, the Seahawks and NBA’s Trail Blazers have been owned by his sister, Jody. The estate agreed in September to sell the Trail Blazers to an investment group led by Carolina Hurricanes owner Tom Dundon.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

The goal sent the Czech bench and fans into a wild celebration, but it was short-lived.Canada even staying in the tournament has a major concern after losing Sidney Crosby to injury five minutes into the second period.

        "text": "Trader William Lawrence works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Friday, Feb. 13, 2026, in New York. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)2026-02-18T04:55:05Z\n                                        NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. stock market is rising on Wednesday, led by its most influential stock, Nvidia. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.9% and pulled within 1.1% of its all-time high set late last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 308 points, or 0.6%, as of 12:21 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.3% higher.Nvidia climbed 2.3% after Meta Platforms announced a long-term partnership where it will use millions of chips and other equipment from Nvidia for its artificial-intelligence data centers. “No one deploys AI at Meta’s scale,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said. Because his company is the most valuable on Wall Street, Nvidia’s stock was the single most powerful force pulling the S&amp;P 500 higher.That performance demonstrated the upside of AI development for the U.S. stock market. But investors have also focused on the potential downsides recently, which has led to sharp swings for Wall Street. Worries are rising, for example, about how much companies like Meta are spending on AI and whether they can possibly make back their huge investments through higher profits and productivity in the future.\n    \n        \n    \n\nMeta’s stock fell as much as 1.7% before bouncing back to a gain of 0.3%. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nAnother big worry is that if AI succeeds in creating tools to do complicated tasks more cheaply, companies in industries as far flung as software and legal services and trucking logistics may see their businesses get undercut. That has pushed investors to suddenly and aggressively punish stocks of companies seen as under threat, and analysts have likened it to a “shoot first-ask questions later” mentality.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nSeveral profit reports from companies helped to lift stocks Wednesday. They continued what’s been a strong reporting season for the big U.S. companies in the S&amp;P 500. Cadence Design Systems climbed 9.1% after delivering both profit and revenue for the latest quarter that topped analysts’ expectations. CEO Anirudh Devgan credited what he called “the essential nature of Cadence’s engineering software,” even as investors worry about AI threatening to remake the industry. \n    \n        \n    \n\nAnalog Devices rose 2.7% after likewise topping analysts’ estimates for profit and revenue. The chip company said it saw record orders during the quarter for its data center business. Outside of earnings reports, Moderna rose 5.5% after saying regulators at the Food and Drug Administration will review its flu vaccine candidate after earlier refusing to consider it. They helped offset a 5.5% drop for Palo Alto Networks. The cybersecurity company reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, but it gave profit forecasts for the current quarter and the remainder of its fiscal year that fell short of their estimates.In the bond market, Treasury yields ticked higher ahead of the afternoon’s release of minutes from the latest meeting of the Federal Reserve. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.07% from 4.05% late Tuesday. The Fed has put a pause on its cuts to interest rates, but many on Wall Street expect it to resume later this year. Details within the last meeting’s minutes could alter bets for when that could be. The widespread expectation is that it will come during the summer, after a new chair is scheduled to step in atop the Fed. \n    \n        \n    \n\nLower rates can give a boost to the economy and prices for investments, but that comes at the cost of potentially worsening inflation. Some better-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy also helped to lift Treasury yields. One said that industrial production improved last month by more than economists expected. Another said orders for computers, fabricated metal products and other long-lasting manufactured goods rose more in December than economists expected, when not including airplanes and other transportation equipment. A third report said homebuilders broke ground on more new homes in December than expected. Such strong data could encourage the Federal Reserve to keep its pause on cuts to rates for longer. In stock markets abroad, London’s FTSE 100 climbed 1.3% after the latest update on U.K. inflation bolstered expectations that the Bank of England may soon cut interest rates. \n    \n        \n    \n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1% as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi was reappointed by the parliament following a landslide victory for her ruling Liberal Democrats in a Feb. 8 election. The expectation is that she will push through policies to help the economy and markets. Elsewhere in Asia, several markets were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. ___AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.",

        "title": "What to know about avalanches, what causes them and how to stay safe",
        "text": "2026-02-18T17:05:32Z\n                                        An avalanche — a mass of snow moving down a slope — happens most often in the wilderness. Watching for forecasts, bringing the proper gear and getting training to prepare for them can help with outings, according to the National Avalanche Center. Each winter, about 25 people on average die in avalanches in the United States, the center says, adding, “Some days are dangerous and some days are not.” Here’s a look at avalanches, how they occur and some tips on how to stay safe:How do avalanches occur?It generally takes just two ingredients to create dangerous conditions: A slope of 30 degrees or more and layers upon layers of snow.Extra pressure on top of that snowpack from weight, wind, rain, heavy snow or motion can cause some of the layers to shear off and slide downhill.Sometimes a slide happens in the form of loose snow, called a sluff. Sluffs account for only a small percentage of deaths and property damage from avalanches, according to the Sierra Avalanche Center.\n    \n        \n    \n\nOther avalanches are made up of slabs, which happen when a large layer of snow breaks away. Those account for most fatalities.Another kind of avalanche occurs when wind creates a cornice of snow that hangs over a ridge or the edge of a steep slope. The overhang can collapse suddenly, catching anyone underneath or on top of it by surprise, according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nWhat triggers an avalanche?Movement, rapidly changing weather, wind — any one of these things can set off an avalanche. But experts say 90% of slides that cause an injury or death are triggered by the victim or a companion.That means people who ski, snowmobile, snowshoe or enjoy other winter backcountry activities should check the avalanche forecast before they head out and make sure they have the right safety gear.Most ski resorts have avalanche protocols or mitigation systems. Often that means checking snowpack stability. Remote detonations are also used to trigger slides intentionally and remove risky buildup before skiers are allowed on the slopes, said Chris Lundy, an avalanche specialist with the National Avalanche Center.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nHow can one avoid an avalanche?Don’t think for a second that you can outrun one. Dry slab avalanches typically reach speeds up to 80 mph (129 kph) within seconds, according to the Sierra Avalanche Center. Wet avalanches usually travel around 20 mph (32 kph).By comparison eight-time Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt set a record of just under 28 mph (45 kph) in the 100-meter dash in 2009 — and that was on a flat track, not a snow-covered slope. Most people caught in avalanches are on the slope when they occur.The better plan is to make sure you’re not in a place where one is at risk of occurring. Outdoor enthusiasts can check forecasts at regional avalanche centers or www.avalanche.org.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIf you do venture out, it’s a good idea to use the buddy system and be versed in wilderness first aid. Experts say three pieces of gear are essential: an avalanche beacon or transceiver, which sends location signals to others; a shovel to test snowpack or dig out companions; and a thin, folding pole to poke into the snow in search of anyone buried. An avalanche airbag backpack that inflates after the skier pulls the trigger giving the person a chance to stay above or close to the surface during an avalanche.\n    \n        \n    \n\nWhat were some recent avalanches?On Jan. 5, an avalanche in California’s Sierra Nevada buried a snowmobiler in snow and killed him, authorities said. The snowmobiler was initially reported missing but then was found under the snow several minutes later, the Nevada County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. In June 2025, a skier died after being caught in an avalanche on Alaska’s Mount McKinley, North America’s tallest peak. The Denali National Park and Preserve said the skier and his climbing partner, a snowboarder, triggered the avalanche high on the 20,310-foot (6,190-meter) peak while descending a slope.That March, a snowmachiner riding on the backside of a popular winter recreation area about 60 miles (97 kilometers) southeast of Anchorage, triggered an avalanche after riding over a weak layer of snow that was buried under newer snow, according to the Chugach National Forest Avalanche Center. He was buried about 10-feet (3-meter) deep in the slide that measured about 500 feet (152 meters) wide.\n    \n        \n    \n\nEarlier that month, three heli-skiers were killed. That accident happened when they were caught in an avalanche near Girdwood, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of Anchorage. Heli-skiing is a type of backcountry skiing that involves using a helicopter to access remote areas and slopes of fresh snow.",

        "text": "In the rapidly evolving world of engineering technology, professionals devote enormous energy to such tasks as mastering the latest frameworks, optimizing architectures, and refining machine learning models. It’s easy to let technical expertise become the sole measure of professional value. However, one of the most important skills an engineer can develop is the capacity to write and communicate effectively.Whether you’re conducting research at a university or leading systems development projects at a global firm, your expertise can become impactful only when you share it in a way that others can understand and act upon. Without a clear narrative, even groundbreaking data or innovative designs can fail to gain traction, limiting their reach among colleagues and stakeholders, and in peer‑reviewed journals.The cost of the “soft skill” misnomerWriting is often labeled a “soft skill”—which can diminish its importance. In reality, communication is a core engineering competency. It lets us document methods, articulate research findings, and persuade decision-makers who determine whether projects move forward.If your writing is dense, disorganized, or overloaded with technical jargon, the value of the underlying work can become obscured. A strong proposal might be dismissed not because the idea lacks merit but because the justification is difficult to follow.Clear writing can strengthen the impact of your work. Poor writing can distract from the points you’re trying to make, as readers might not understand what you’re saying.The architecture of authorityTechnical writing differs from other forms of prose because readers expect information to follow predictable, logical patterns. Unclear writing can leave readers unsure of the author’s intent.One of the most enduring frameworks for writing about technology in an understandable manner is the IMRaD structure: introduction, methods, results, and discussion.Introduction: Define the problem and its relevance.Methods: Detail the approach and justify the choices.Results: Present the empirical findings.Discussion: Interpret the outcomes and their implications.More than just a template for academic papers, IMRaD is a road map for logical reasoning. Mastering the structure can help engineers communicate in a way that aligns with professional writing standards used in technical journals, so their work is better understood and more respected.Bridging the training gapDespite technical communication’s importance, engineering curricula often limit or lack formal instruction in it.Recognizing that gap, IEEE has expanded its role as a global knowledge leader by offering From Research to Publication: A Step-by-Step Guide to Technical Writing. The course is led by Traci Nathans-Kelly, director of the engineering communications program at Cornell.Developed by IEEE Educational Activities and the IEEE Professional Communication Society, the learning opportunity goes beyond foundational writing skills. It addresses today’s challenges, such as the ethical use of generative AI in the writing workflow, the complexities of team-based authorship, and publishing strategies.The program centers on core skill areas that can influence an engineer’s ability to communicate. Participants learn to master the IMRaD structure and learn advanced editing techniques to help strip away jargon, making complex ideas more accessible. In addition, the course covers strategic approaches to publishing work in high‑impact journals and improving a writer’s visibility within the technical community.The course is available on the IEEE Learning Network. Participants earn professional development credit and a shareable digital badge. IEEE members receive a US $100 discount. Organizations can connect with an IEEE content specialist to offer the training to their teams.",

It could even release drugs exactly where they’re needed or snip a tiny biopsy sample before passing harmlessly out of your body.This dream of a do-it-all pill is driving a surge of research into ingestible electronics: smart capsules designed to monitor and even treat disease from inside the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The stakes are high. GI diseases affect tens of millions of people worldwide, including such ailments as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Diagnosis often involves a frustrating maze of blood tests, imaging, and invasive endoscopy. Treatments, meanwhile, can bring serious side effects because drugs affect the whole body, not just the troubled gut.If capsules could handle much of that work—streamlining diagnosis, delivering targeted therapies, and sparing patients repeated invasive procedures—they could transform care. Over the past 20 years, researchers have built a growing tool kit of ingestible devices, some already in clinical use. These capsule-shaped devices typically contain sensors, circuitry, a power source, and sometimes a communication module, all enclosed in a biocompatible shell. But the next leap forward is still in development: autonomous capsules that can both sense and act, releasing a drug or taking a tissue sample.That’s the challenge that our lab—the MEMS Sensors and Actuators Laboratory (MSAL) at the University of Maryland, College Park—is tackling. Drawing on decades of advances in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), we’re building swallowable devices that integrate sensors, actuators, and wireless links in packages that are small and safe enough for patients. The hurdles are considerable: power, miniaturization, biocompatibility, and reliability, to name a few. But the potential payoff will be a new era of personalized and minimally invasive medicine, delivered by something as simple as a pill you can swallow at home.The Origin of Ingestible Devices The idea of a smart capsule has been around since the late 1950s, when researchers first experimented with swallowable devices to record temperature, gastric pH, or pressure inside the digestive tract. At the time, it seemed closer to science fiction than clinical reality, bolstered by pop-culture visions like the 1966 film Fantastic Voyage, where miniaturized doctors travel inside the human body to treat a blood clot. One of the authors (Ghodssi) holds a miniaturized drug-delivery capsule that’s designed to release medication at specific sites in the gastrointestinal tract.Maximilian Franz/Engineering at Maryland Magazine For decades, though, the mainstay of GI diagnostics was endoscopy: a camera on a flexible tube, threaded down the throat or up through the colon. These procedures are quite invasive and require patients to be sedated, which increases both the risk of complications and procedural costs. What’s more, it’s difficult for endoscopes to safely traverse the circuitous pathway of the small intestine. The situation changed in the early 2000s, when video-capsule endoscopy arrived. The best-known product, PillCam, looks like a large vitamin but contains a camera, LEDs, and a transmitter. As it passes through the gut, it beams images and videos to a wearable device.Today, capsule endoscopy is a routine tool in gastroenterology; ingestible devices can measure acidity, temperature, or gas concentrations. And researchers are pushing further, with experimental prototypes that deliver drugs or analyze the microbiome. For example, teams from Tufts University, in Massachusetts, and Purdue University, in Indiana, are working on devices with dissolvable coatings and mechanisms to collect samples of liquid for studies of the intestinal microbiome.Still, all those devices are passive. They activate on a timer or by exposure to the neutral pH of the intestines, but they don’t adapt to conditions in real time. The next step requires capsules that can sense biomarkers, make decisions, and trigger specific actions—moving from clever hardware to truly autonomous “smart pills.” That’s where our work comes in.Building on MEMS technology Since 2017, MSAL has been pushing ingestible devices forward with the goal of making an immediate impact in health care. The group built on the MEMS community’s legacy in microfabrication, sensors, and system integration, while taking advantage of new tools like 3D printing and materials like biocompatible polymers. Those advances have made it possible to prototype faster and shrink devices smaller, sparking a wave of innovation in wearables, implants, and now ingestibles. Today, MSAL is collaborating with engineers, physicians, and data scientists to move these capsules from lab benches to pharmaceutical trials.As a first step, back in 2017, we set out to design sensor-carrying capsules that could reliably reach the small intestine and indicate when they reached it. Another challenge was that sensors that work well on the benchtop can falter inside the gut, where shifting pH, moisture, digestive enzymes, and low-oxygen conditions can degrade typical sensing components. Our earliest prototype adapted MEMS sensing technology to detect abnormal enzyme levels in the duodenum that are linked to pancreatic function. The sensor and its associated electronics were enclosed in a biocompatible, 3D-printed shell coated with polymers that dissolved only at certain pH levels. This strategy could one day be used to detect biomarkers in secretions from the pancreas to detect early-stage cancer. A high-speed video shows how a capsule deploys microneedles to deliver drugs into intestinal tissue.University of Maryland/Elsevier That first effort with a passive device taught us the fundamentals of capsule design and opened the door to new applications. Since then, we’ve developed sensors that can track biomarkers such as the gas hydrogen sulfide, neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine, and bioimpedance—a measure of how easily ions pass through intestinal tissue—to shed light on the gut microbiome, inflammation, and disease progression. In parallel, we’ve worked on more-active devices: capsule-based tools for controlled drug release and tissue biopsy, using low-power actuators to trigger precise mechanical movements inside the gut.Like all new medical devices and treatments, ingestible electronics face many hurdles before they reach patients—from earning physician trust and insurance approval to demonstrating clear benefits, safety, and reliability. Packaging is a particular focus, as the capsules must be easy to swallow yet durable enough to survive stomach acid. The field is steadily proving safety and reliability, progressing from proof of concept in tissue, through the different stages of animal studies, and eventually to human trials. Every stage provides evidence that reassures doctors and patients—for example, showing that ingesting a properly packaged tiny battery is safe, and that a capsule’s wireless signals, far weaker than those of a cellphone, pose no health risk as they pass through the gut.Engineering a Pill-Size Diagnostic Lab The gastrointestinal tract is packed with clues about health and disease, but much of it remains out of reach of standard diagnostic tools. Ingestible capsules offer a way in, providing direct access to the small intestine and colon. Yet in many cases, the concentrations of chemical biomarkers can be too low to detect reliably in early stages of a disease, which makes the engineering challenge formidable. What’s more, the gut’s corrosive, enzyme-rich environment can foul sensors in multiple ways, interfering with measurements and adding noise to the data.    Microneedle designs for drug-delivery capsules have evolved over the years. An early prototype [top] used microneedle anchors to hold a capsule in place. Later designs adopted molded microneedle arrays [center] for more uniform fabrication. The most recent version [bottom] integrates hollow microinjector needles, allowing more precise and controllable drug delivery.From top: University of Maryland/Wiley;University of Maryland/Elsevier;University of Maryland/ACS Take, for example, inflammatory bowel disease, for which there is no standard clinical test. Rather than searching for a scarce biomarker molecule, our team focused on a physical change: the permeability of the gut lining, which is a key factor in the disease. We designed capsules that measure the intestinal tissue’s bioimpedance by sending tiny currents across electrodes and recording how the tissue resists or conducts those currents at different frequencies (a technique called impedance spectroscopy). To make the electrodes suitable for in vivo use, we coated them with a thin, conductive, biocompatible polymer that reduces electrical noise and keeps stable contact with the gut wall. The capsule finishes its job by transmitting its data wirelessly to our computers.In our lab tests, the capsule performed impressively, delivering clean impedance readouts from excised pig tissue even when the sample was in motion. In our animal studies, it detected shifts in permeability triggered by calcium chelators, compounds that pry open the tight junctions between intestinal cells. These results suggest that ingestible bioimpedance capsules could one day give clinicians a direct, minimally invasive window into gut-barrier function and inflammation. We believe that ingestible diagnostics can serve as powerful tools—catching disease earlier, confirming whether treatments are working, and establishing a baseline for gut health.Drug Delivery at the Right Place, Right Time Targeted drug delivery is one of the most compelling applications for ingestible capsules. Many drugs for GI conditions—such as biologics for inflammatory bowel disease—can cause serious side effects that limit both dosage and duration of treatment. A promising alternative is delivering a drug directly to the diseased tissue. This localized approach boosts the drug’s concentration at the target site while reducing its spread throughout the body, which improves effectiveness and minimizes side effects. The challenge is engineering a device that can both recognize diseased tissue and deliver medication quickly and precisely.With other labs making great progress on the sensing side, we’ve devoted our energy to designing devices that can deliver the medicine. We’ve developed miniature actuators—tiny moving parts—that meet strict criteria for use inside the body: low power, small size, biocompatibility, and long shelf life.Some of our designs use soft and flexible polymer “cantilevers” with attached microneedle systems that pop out from the capsule with enough force to release a drug, but without harming the intestinal tissue. While hollow microneedles can directly inject drugs into the intestinal lining, we’ve also demonstrated prototypes that use the microneedles for anchoring drug payloads, allowing the capsule to release a larger dose of medication that dissolves at an exact location over time.In other experimental designs, we had the microneedles themselves dissolve after injecting a drug. In still others, we used microscale 3D printing to tailor the structure of the microneedles and control how quickly a drug is released—providing either a slow and sustained dose or a fast delivery. With this 3D printing, we created rigid microneedles that penetrate the mucosal lining and gradually diffuse the drug into the tissue, and soft microneedles that compress when the cantilever pushes them against the tissue, forcing the drug out all at once.Tissue Biopsy via CapsuleWhat Smart Capsules Can DoIngestible electronic capsules use miniaturized sensors and actuators to monitor the gut, deliver medication, and collect biological samples.Sensing Embedded sensors can probe the gut—for example, measuring the bioimpedance of the intestinal lining to detect disease—and transmit the data wirelessly.All illustrations: Chris PhilpotDrug delivery Miniature actuators can trigger drug release at specific sites in the gut, boosting effectiveness while limiting side effects.Biopsy A spring-loaded mechanism can collect a tiny biopsy sample from the gut wall and store it during the capsule’s passage through the digestive system.Tissue sampling remains the gold standard diagnostic tool in gastroenterology, offering insights far beyond what doctors can glean from visual inspection or blood tests. Capsules hold unique promise here: They can travel the full length of the GI tract, potentially enabling more frequent and affordable biopsies than traditional procedures. But the engineering hurdles are substantial. To collect a sample, a device must generate significant mechanical force to cut through the tough, elastic muscle of the intestines—while staying small enough to swallow.Different strategies have been explored to solve this problem. Torsion springs can store large amounts of energy but are difficult to fit inside a tiny capsule. Electrically driven mechanisms may demand more power than current capsule batteries can provide. Magnetic actuation is another option, but it requires bulky external equipment and precise tracking of the capsule inside the body.Our group has developed a low-power biopsy system that builds on the torsion-spring approach. We compress a spring and use adhesive to “latch” it closed within the capsule, then attach a microheater to the latch. When we wirelessly send current to the device, the microheater melts the adhesive on the latch, triggering the spring. We’ve experimented with tissue-collection tools, integrating a bladed scraper or a biopsy punch (a cylindrical cutting tool) with our spring-activated mechanisms; either of those tools can cut and collect tissue from the intestinal lining. With advanced 3D printing methods like direct laser writing, we can put fine, microscale edges on these miniature cutting tools that make it easier for them to penetrate the intestinal lining.Storing and protecting the sample until the capsule naturally passes through the body is a major challenge, requiring both preservation of the sample and resealing the capsule to prevent contamination. In one of our designs, residual tension in the spring keeps the bladed scraper rotating, pulling the sample into the capsule and effectively closing a hatch that seals it inside.The Road to Clinical Use for Ingestibles Looking ahead, we expect to see the first clinical applications emerge in early-stage screening. Capsules that can detect electrochemical, bioimpedance, or visual signals could help doctors make sense of symptoms like vague abdominal pain by revealing inflammation, gut permeability, tumors, or bacterial overgrowth. They could also be adapted to screen for GI cancers. This need is pressing: The American Cancer Society reports that as of 2021, 41 percent of eligible U.S. adults were not up to date on colorectal cancer screening. What’s more, effective screening tools don’t yet exist for some diseases, such as small bowel adenocarcinoma. Capsule technology could make screening less invasive and more accessible.Of course, ingestible capsules carry risks. The standard hazards of endoscopy still apply, such as the possibility of bleeding and perforation, and capsules introduce new complications. For example, if a capsule gets stuck in its passage through the GI tract, it could cause bowel obstruction and require endoscopic retrieval or even surgery. And concerns that are specific to ingestibles, including the biocompatibility of materials, reliable encapsulation of electronics, and safe battery operation, all demand rigorous testing before clinical use.  A microbe-powered biobattery designed for ingestible devices dissolves in water within an hour.            Seokheun Choi/Binghamton University        Powering these capsules is a key challenge that must be solved on the path to the clinic. Most capsule endoscopes today rely on coin-cell batteries, typically silver oxide, which offer a safe and energy-dense source but often occupy 30 to 50 percent of the capsule’s volume. So researchers have investigated alternatives, from wireless power transfer to energy-harvesting systems. At the State University of New York at Binghamton, one team is exploring microbial fuel cells that generate electricity from probiotic bacteria interacting with nutrients in the gut. At MIT, researchers used the gastric fluids of a pig’s stomach to power a simple battery. In our own lab, we are exploring piezoelectric and electrochemical approaches to harvesting energy throughout the GI tract.The next steps for our team are pragmatic ones: working with gastroenterologists and animal-science experts to put capsule prototypes through rigorous in vivo studies, then refining them for real-world use. That means shrinking the electronics, cutting power consumption, and integrating multiple functions into a single multimodal device that can sense, sample, and deliver treatments in one pass. Ultimately, any candidate capsule will require regulatory approval for clinical use, which in turn demands rigorous proof of safety and clinical effectiveness for a specific medical application.The broader vision is transformative. Swallowable capsules could bring diagnostics and treatment out of the hospital and into patients’ homes. Whereas procedures with endoscopes require anesthesia, patients could take ingestible electronics easily and routinely. Consider, for example, patients with inflammatory bowel disease who live with an elevated risk of cancer; a smart capsule could perform yearly cancer checks, while also delivering medication directly wherever necessary.Over time, we expect these systems to evolve into semiautonomous tools: identifying lesions, performing targeted biopsies, and perhaps even analyzing samples and applying treatment in place. Achieving that vision will require advances at the very edge of microelectronics, materials science, and biomedical engineering, bringing together capabilities that once seemed impossible to combine in something the size of a pill. These devices hint at a future in which the boundary between biology and technology dissolves, and where miniature machines travel inside the body to heal us from within.",

        "text": "APOE is a component of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles that carry cholesterol from the liver to where it is needed in the body. Lowering circulating LDL-cholesterol levels to modestly slow the progression of atherosclerosis is the primary approach taken in cardiovascular medicine; in recent years, new forms of LDL-lowering therapy such as PCSK9 inhibitors have been used to dramatically reduce LDL-cholesterol to far below normal levels with no immediately apparent prohibitively negative effects on patients. In today's open access paper, researchers show that elevated APOE levels are a feature of old age and negatively affect bone regeneration, likely by suppressing the creation of osteoblast cells responsible for producing bone extracellular matrix structures. A near complete elimination of APOE production in the liver (which [&#8230;]",

First introduced as a treatment for leukemia, this remains a very expensive form of therapy, and so is not as widely developed for new uses as might otherwise be the case. Nonetheless, a steady stream of proof of concept studies exists, such as the example here in which CAR technology is applied to target protein aggregates in the context of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the prevailing cause of age-associated dementia worldwide. Current standard of care relies on antibody-based immunotherapy. However, antibody-based approaches carry risks for patients, and their effects [&#8230;]",
