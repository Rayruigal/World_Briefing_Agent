President Herzog will also conduct interviews with the media during the visit.That’s a really distorted figure. And why I say that is that figure comes across 150 electorates from around the country. And as Nationals, we only stand in about 20 to 30 seats. So we don’t run in any city seats. [In] a lot of cities, we wouldn’t poll at all. We’d poll zero in Wentworth. We’d poll zero in Kooyong. We’d poll zero in Perth because we don’t stand candidates there.One Nation aren’t a regional party. I mean, One Nation are running across every seat across the whole country. So I mean it’s not even comparable in that sense. But you know obviously their figures have gone up very much since post-Bondi, and that has to be noted. Continue reading...",

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)2026-02-08T11:00:06Z\n                                        SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — It’s almost time to crown an NFL champion.After two weeks of hype and anticipation, the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks will face off in Super Bowl 60 at Levi’s Stadium on Sunday.Will Drake Maye and the Patriots (17-3) capture their seventh Lombardi Trophy? Or will Sam Darnold and the Seahawks (16-3) earn their second?The matchup features two stingy defenses, two balanced offenses and two quarterbacks who’ve taken vastly different routes to get here.Led by defensive tackle Leonard Williams, linebacker Ernest Jones, cornerback Devon Witherspoon and rookie safety Nick Emmanwori, the Seahawks allowed the fewest points in the NFL and have standout players at every level.The Patriots advanced to a record 12th Super Bowl because their defense has been dominant in the playoffs, allowing only 8.7 points per game.\n    \n        \n    \n\nDarnold has All-Pro wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, veteran wideout Cooper Kupp and running back Kenneth Walker around him.Running backs TreVeyon Henderson and Rhamondre Stevenson and wide receiver Stefon Diggs give Maye plenty of support on New England’s offense.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe 23-year old Maye will be the second-youngest quarterback to start a Super Bowl. He’s aiming to become the youngest to win it.The Patriots won six rings with coach Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. AP NFL Coach of the Year Mike Vrabel, who was a linebacker on three of those teams, is seeking his first as a head coach.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nSeahawks coach Mike Macdonald is only in his second season and first with Darnold, who’s on his fifth team in eight years in the NFL. The 2018 No. 3 overall pick has finally found a home after bouncing around the league.This is a rematch of the Super Bowl 11 years ago. Brady and the Patriots won that one, 28-24, after Russell Wilson’s pass from the 1-yard line in the final minute was intercepted by Malcolm Butler.According to BetMGM Sportsbook, the Patriots are 4 1/2-point underdogs against Seattle.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                ROB MAADDI\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Maaddi is senior NFL writer for The Associated Press.

        "text": "SummaryThe Seattle Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots 29–13 in Super Bowl LX, securing the franchise's second championshipKicker Jason Myers tied a Super Bowl record with five field goals, while the defense forced multiple turnovers from Patriots QB Drake MayeThe victory serves as a narrative redemption for the team's 2015 loss to New England and caps a comeback season for quarterback Sam Darnold11 years after one of the most painful losses in sports history, the Seattle Seahawks have finally flipped the script. On Sunday night at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Seattle defeated the New England Patriots 29–13 to win Super Bowl LX, earning the second title in franchise history. In a game billed as a rematch of Super Bowl XLIX—famous for the Malcolm Butler interception—the Seahawks relied on a suffocating defense and the steady leg of kicker Jason Myers to deny New England a league-leading seventh championship. The victory also completes an improbable redemption arc for quarterback Sam Darnold, who hoisted the Lombardi Trophy after revitalizing his career in the Pacific Northwest.For much of the evening, the game was a defensive grind that saw the Patriots shut out for three quarters—a drought not seen in the Super Bowl since the 1973 Minnesota Vikings. Seattle’s offense, while struggling to find the end zone early, capitalized on field position. Jason Myers became the game's unlikely MVP candidate, converting five field goals—including a 41-yarder—to tie a Super Bowl record and give Seattle a commanding 15-0 lead heading into the final frame. The Patriots' rookie sensation Drake Maye struggled under the bright lights, facing constant pressure and suffering five sacks.The game broke open in the fourth quarter when Seattle’s defense turned pressure into points. Cornerback Devon Witherspoon blitzed Maye, forcing a fumble that linebacker Uchenna Nwosu scooped up and returned 45 yards for a touchdown, effectively sealing the game. While Patriots quarterback Drake Maye managed late touchdown passes to Mack Hollins and Rhamondre Stevenson to narrow the deficit, the hole was too deep to climb out of. Seattle’s tight end AJ Barner also contributed the game’s first touchdown, catching a 16-yard strike from Darnold following another Patriots turnover.Beyond the gridiron action, the night was historic for its cultural milestones. Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny headlined the Apple Music Halftime Show, becoming the first artist to perform a primarily Spanish-language set at the event. Bringing a \"huge party\" atmosphere to the field with guests Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin, the performance celebrated Latin culture amidst the high-stakes athletics. The Seattle Seahawks will return to the Pacific Northwest for a victory parade scheduled later this week, while the NFL offseason officially begins.&nbsp;View this post on Instagram&nbsp;A post shared by Seattle Seahawks (@seahawks)&nbsp;View this post on Instagram&nbsp;A post shared by NFL (@nfl)Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "Hunter Hess, of the United States, executes a trick in the halfpipe finals during the World Cup U.S. Grand Prix freestyle skiing event in Copper Mountain, Colo., Dec. 17, 2022. (AP Photo/Hugh Carey, File)2026-02-08T19:58:04Z\n                                        MILAN (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday said that it is hard to cheer for American Olympians who are speaking out against administration policies, calling one such critic “a real Loser” who perhaps should have stayed home. It was the latest and most prominent example of U.S. Olympians at the Milan Cortina Games inviting online backlash with their words.Reporters on Friday asked U.S. athletes at a news conference how they feel representing the country during the Trump administration’s heighted immigration enforcement actions. Freestyle skier Hunter Hess replied that he had mixed emotions since he doesn’t agree with the situation, and that he is in Milan competing on behalf of everyone who helped get him to The Games.“If it aligns with my moral values, I feel like I’m representing it,” Hess said. “Just because I’m wearing the flag doesn’t mean I represent everything that’s going on in the U.S.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nAmong those who piled on Hess were YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul.“From all true Americans If you don’t want to represent this country go live somewhere else,” he wrote on X, where he has 4.4 million followers. Minutes later, he was photographed sitting beside U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the U.S women’s hockey game in Olympic host city Milan.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nTrump said the next day that Hess’ comments make it hard to root for him. “Hess, a real Loser, says he doesn’t represent his Country in the current Winter Olympics. If that’s the case, he shouldn’t have tried out for the Team, and it’s too bad he’s on it,” he wrote on his Truth Social account.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nHess wasn’t the only athlete voicing discontent — or facing blowbackAt Friday’s news conference with the athletes, freestyle skier Chris Lillis referenced Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying he’s “heartbroken” about what is happening in the U.S.“I think that, as a country, we need to focus on respecting everybody’s rights and making sure that we’re treating our citizens as well as anybody, with love and respect,” Lillis said. “I hope that when people look at athletes compete in the Olympics, they realize that that’s the America that we’re trying to represent.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nAnd U.S. figure skater Amber Glenn said the LGBTQ+ community has had a hard time during the Trump administration. In addition to Paul, conservative figures criticizing the athletes on social media include former NFL quarterback Brett Favre, actor Rob Schneider and U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds — who Trump has endorsed for the Florida gubernatorial race in November. And there was a flood of vitriol directed at them from ordinary Americans. Glenn posted on Instagram that she had received “a scary amount of hate / threats for simply using my voice WHEN ASKED about how I feel.” She added that she will start limiting her social media use for her well-being.In response to questions from The Associated Press, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee said in a statement Sunday that it is aware of an increasing amount of abusive and harmful messages directed toward the athletes and was doing its best to remove content and report credible threats to law enforcement.“The USOPC stands firmly behind Team USA athletes and remains committed to their well-being and safety, both on and off the field of play,” it said.\n    \n        \n    \n\nAnti-ICE protests in ItalySupport for the U.S. abroad has eroded as the Trump administration has pursued an aggressive posture on foreign policy, including punishing tariffs, military action in Venezuela and threats to invade Greenland.During the opening ceremony, Team USA athletes were cheered on, but jeers and whistles could be heard as Vance and his wife, second lady Usha Vance, were shown on the stadium screens, waving American flags from the tribune.In Milan, several demonstrations have broken out against the against the local deployment of ICE agents — even after clarification that they are from an investigations unit that is completely separate from the enforcement unit at the forefront of the immigration crackdown in the U.S.Homeland Security Investigations, an ICE unit that focuses on cross-border crimes, frequently sends its officers to overseas events like the Olympics to assist with security.

Guanipa’s brother Tomás rejected the accusation, and said that the arrest was meant to crack down on dissent.“Thinking differently cannot be criminalized in Venezuela, and today, Juan Pablo Guanipa is a prisoner of conscience of this regime,” Tomás Guanipa said after the arrest. “He has the right to think as he thinks, the right to defend his ideas, and the right to be treated under a constitution that is not being enforced today.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nJuan Pablo Guanipa’s release comes during mounting pressure on the government of acting President Delcy Rodríguez to release all people whose detentions months or years ago have been linked by their families and nongovernmental organizations to their political beliefs.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nRodríguez was sworn in as Venezuela’s acting president after the capture of then President Nicolás Maduro by the U.S. military last month.

        "title": "FBI concluded Jeffrey Epstein wasn’t running a sex trafficking ring for powerful men, files show",
        "text": "Documents that were included in the U.S. Department of Justice release of the Jeffrey Epstein files are photographed Friday, Jan. 2, 2026. (AP Photo/Jon Elswick, File)2026-02-08T15:30:20Z\n                                        NEW YORK (AP) — The FBI pored over Jeffrey Epstein’s bank records and emails. It searched his homes. It spent years interviewing his victims and examining his connections to some of the world’s most influential people.But while investigators collected ample proof that Epstein sexually abused underage girls, they found scant evidence the well-connected financier led a sex trafficking ring serving powerful men, an Associated Press review of internal Justice Department records shows.Videos and photos seized from Epstein’s homes in New York, Florida and the Virgin Islands didn’t depict victims being abused or implicate anyone else in his crimes, a prosecutor wrote in one 2025 memo.An examination of Epstein’s financial records, including payments he made to entities linked to influential figures in academia, finance and global diplomacy, found no connection to criminal activity, said another internal memo in 2019.\n    \n        \n    \n\nWhile one Epstein victim made highly public claims that he “lent her” to his rich friends, agents couldn’t confirm that and found no other victims telling a similar story, the records said.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nSummarizing the investigation in an email last July, agents said “four or five” Epstein accusers claimed other men or women had sexually abused them. But, the agents said, there “was not enough evidence to federally charge these individuals, so the cases were referred to local law enforcement.”\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe AP and other media organizations are still reviewing millions of pages of documents, many of them previously confidential, that the Justice Department released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act and it is possible those records contain evidence overlooked by investigators.But the documents, which include police reports, FBI interview notes and prosecutor emails, provide the clearest picture to date of the investigation — and why U.S. authorities ultimately decided to close it without additional charges.\n    \n        \n    \n\nDozens of victims come forward The Epstein investigation began in 2005, when the parents of a 14-year-old girl reported she had been molested at the millionaire’s home in Palm Beach, Florida.Police would identify at least 35 girls with similar stories: Epstein was paying high school age students $200 or $300 to give him sexualized massages.After the FBI joined the probe, federal prosecutors drafted indictments to charge Epstein and some personal assistants who had arranged the girls’ visits and payments. But instead, then-Miami U.S. attorney Alexander Acosta struck a deal letting Epstein plead guilty to state charges of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl. Sentenced to 18 months in jail, Epstein was free by mid-2009.In 2018, a series of Miami Herald stories about the plea deal prompted New York federal prosecutors to take a fresh look at the accusations.Epstein was arrested in July 2019. One month later, he killed himself in his jail cell.A year later, prosecutors charged Epstein’s longtime confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, saying she’d recruited several of his victims and sometimes joined the sexual abuse. Convicted in 2021, Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison term.\n    \n        \n    \n\nProsecutors fail to find evidence backing most sensational claimsProsecution memos, case summaries and other documents made public in the department’s latest release of Epstein-related records show that FBI agents and federal prosecutors diligently pursued potential coconspirators. Even seemingly outlandish and incomprehensible claims, called in to tip lines, were examined.Some allegations couldn’t be verified, investigators wrote.In 2011 and again in 2019, investigators interviewed Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who in lawsuits and news interviews had accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters with numerous men, including Britain’s former Prince Andrew.Investigators said they confirmed that Giuffre had been sexually abused by Epstein. But other parts of her story were problematic.Two other Epstein victims who Giuffre had claimed were also “lent out” to powerful men told investigators they had no such experience, prosecutors wrote in a 2019 internal memo.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“No other victim has described being expressly directed by either Maxwell or Epstein to engage in sexual activity with other men,” the memo said.Giuffre acknowledged writing a partly fictionalized memoir of her time with Epstein containing descriptions of things that didn’t take place. She had also offered shifting accounts in interviews with investigators, they wrote, and had “engaged in a continuous stream of public interviews about her allegations, many of which have included sensationalized if not demonstrably inaccurate characterizations of her experiences.” Those inaccuracies included false accounts of her interactions with the FBI, they said.Still, U.S. prosecutors attempted to arrange an interview with Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. He refused to make himself available. Giuffre settled a lawsuit with Mountbatten-Windsor in which she had accused him of sexual misconduct.In a memoir published after she killed herself last year, Giuffre wrote that prosecutors told her they didn’t include her in the case against Maxwell because they didn’t want her allegations to distract the jury. She insisted her accounts of being trafficked to elite men were true.\n    \n        \n    \n\nProsecutors say photos and videos don’t implicate othersInvestigators seized a multitude of videos and photos from Epstein’s electronic devices and homes in New York, Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands. They found CDs, hard copy photographs and at least one videotape containing nude images of females, some of whom seemed as if they might be minors. One device contained 15 to 20 images depicting commercial child sex abuse material — pictures investigators said Epstein obtained on the internet.No videos or photos showed Epstein victims being sexually abused, none showed any males with any of the nude females, and none contained evidence implicating anyone other than Epstein and Maxwell, then-Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey wrote in an email for FBI officials last year.Had they existed, the government “would have pursued any leads they generated,” Comey wrote. “We did not, however, locate any such videos.”Investigators who scoured Epstein’s bank records found payments to more than 25 women who appeared to be models — but no evidence that he was engaged in prostituting women to other men, prosecutors wrote.Epstein’s close associates go uncharged In 2019, prosecutors weighed the possibility of charging one of Epstein’s longtime assistants but decided against it.Prosecutors concluded that while the assistant was involved in helping Epstein pay girls for sex and may have been aware that some were underage, she herself was a victim of his sexual abuse and manipulation.Investigators examined Epstein’s relationship with the French modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel, who once was involved in an agency with Epstein in the U.S., and who was accused in a separate case of sexually assaulting women in Europe. Brunel killed himself in jail while awaiting trial on a rape charge in France.Prosecutors also weighed whether to charge one of Epstein’s girlfriends who had participated in sexual acts with some of his victims. Investigators interviewed the girlfriend, who was 18 to 20 years old at the time, “but it was determined there was not enough evidence,” according to a summary given to FBI Director Kash Patel last July.Days before Epstein’s July 2019 arrest, the FBI strategized about sending agents to serve grand jury subpoenas on people close to Epstein, including his pilots and longtime business client, retail mogul Les Wexner.Wexner’s lawyers told investigators that neither he nor his wife had knowledge of Epstein’s sexual misconduct. Epstein had managed Wexner’s finances, but the couple’s lawyers said they cut him off in 2007 after learning he’d stolen from them.“There is limited evidence regarding his involvement,” an FBI agent wrote of Wexner in an Aug. 16, 2019, email.In a statement to the AP, a legal representative for Wexner said prosecutors had informed him that he was “neither a coconspirator nor target in any respect,” and that Wexner had cooperated with investigators.Prosecutors also examined accounts from women who said they’d given massages at Epstein’s home to guests who’d tried to make the encounters sexual. One woman accused private equity investor Leon Black of initiating sexual contact during a massage in 2011 or 2012, causing her to flee the room.The Manhattan district attorney’s office subsequently investigated, but no charges were filed.Black’s lawyer, Susan Estrich, said he had paid Epstein for estate planning and tax advice. She said in a statement that Black didn’t engage in misconduct and had no awareness of Epstein’s criminal activities. Lawsuits by two women who accused Black of sexual misconduct were dismissed or withdrawn. One is pending.No client listAttorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News in February 2025 that Epstein’s never-before-seen “client list” was “sitting on my desk right now.” A few months later, she claimed the FBI was reviewing “tens of thousands of videos” of Epstein “with children or child porn.”But FBI agents wrote superiors saying the client list didn’t exist.On Dec. 30, 2024, about three weeks before President Joe Biden left office, then-FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate reached out through subordinates to ask “whether our investigation to date indicates the ‘client list,’ often referred to in the media, does or does not exist,” according to an email summarizing his query.A day later, an FBI official replied that the case agent had confirmed no client list existed.On Feb. 19, 2025, two days before Bondi’s Fox News appearance, an FBI supervisory special agent wrote: “While media coverage of the Jeffrey Epstein case references a ’client list,’ investigators did not locate such a list during the course of the investigation.”___Aaron Kessler in Washington contributed to this report.___ The AP is reviewing the documents released by the Justice Department in collaboration with journalists from CBS, NBC, MS NOW and CNBC.

        "title": "Hard hats and dummy plates: Reports of ICE ruses add to fears in Minnesota",
        "text": "Federal agents walk down a street while conducting immigration enforcement operations, Thursday, Feb. 5, 2026, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Ryan Murphy, File)2026-02-08T05:08:11Z\n                                        MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — For days, Luis Ramirez had an uneasy feeling about the men dressed as utility workers he’d seen outside his family’s Mexican restaurant in suburban Minneapolis.They wore high-visibility vests and spotless white hard hats, he noticed, even while parked in their vehicle. His search for the Wisconsin-based electrician advertised on the car’s doors returned no results.On Tuesday, when their Nissan returned to the lot outside his restaurant, Ramirez, 31, filmed his confrontation with the two men, who hide their faces as he approaches and appear to be wearing heavy tactical gear beneath their yellow vests.“This is what our taxpayer money goes to: renting these vehicles with fake tags to come sit here and watch my business,” Ramirez shouts in the video.A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to inquiries about whether the men were federal immigration officers. But encounters like Ramirez’s have become increasingly common. \n    \n        \n    \n\nAs the sweeping immigration crackdown in Minnesota continues, legal observers and officials say they have received a growing number of reports of federal agents impersonating construction workers, delivery drivers and in some cases anti-ICE activists. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nNot all of those incidents have been verified, but they have heightened fears in a state already on edge, adding to legal groups’ concerns about the Trump administration’s dramatic reshaping of immigration enforcement tactics nationwide. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“If you have people afraid that the electrical worker outside their house might be ICE, you’re inviting public distrust and confusion on a much more dangerous level,” said Naureen Shah, the director of immigration advocacy at the American Civil Liberties Union. “This is what you do if you’re trying to control a populace, not trying to do routine, professional law enforcement.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nA ‘more extreme degree’ of deceptionIn the past, immigration authorities have sometimes used disguises and other deceptions, which they call ruses, to gain entry into homes without a warrant. The tactics became more common during President Donald Trump’s first term, attorneys said, prompting an ACLU lawsuit accusing immigration agents of violating the U.S. Constitution by posing as local law enforcement during home raids. A recent settlement restricted the practice in Los Angeles. But ICE deceptions remain legal elsewhere in the country.Still, the undercover operations reported in Minnesota would appear to be a “more extreme degree than we’ve seen in the past,” said Shah, in part because they seem to be happening in plain sight. Where past ruses were aimed at deceiving immigration targets, the current tactics may also be a response to the Minnesota’s sprawling networks of citizen observers that have sought to call attention to federal agents before they make arrests.At the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, the city’s central hub of ICE activity, activists told The Associated Press they had seen agents leaving in vehicles with stuffed animals on their dashboards or Mexican flag decals on their bumpers. Pickups with lumber or tools in their beds were also frequently spotted. \n    \n        \n    \n\nIn recent weeks, federal agents have repeatedly shown up to construction sites dressed as workers, according to Jose Alvillar, a lead organizer for the local immigrant rights group, Unidos MN.“We’ve seen an increase in the cowboy tactics,” he said, though he noted the raids had not resulted in arrests. “Construction workers are good at identifying who is a real construction worker and who is dressing up as one.”Using vintage plates Since the start of the operation in Minnesota, local officials, including Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, have said ICE agents had been seen swapping license plates or using bogus ones, a violation of state law.Candice Metrailer, an antiques dealer in south Minneapolis, believes she witnessed such an attempt firsthand. On Jan. 13, she received a call from a man who identified himself as a collector, asking if her store sold license plates. She said it did. A few minutes later, two men in street clothes entered the shop and began looking through her collection of vintage plates. \n    \n        \n    \n\n“One of them says, ‘Hey, do you have any recent ones?’” Metrailer recalled. “Immediately, an alarm bell went off in my head.”Metrailer stepped outside while the men continued browsing. A few doors down from the shop, she saw an idling Ford Explorer with blacked out windows. She memorized its license plate, then quickly plugged it into a crowdsourced database used by local activists to track vehicles linked to immigration enforcement.The database shows an identical Ford with the same plates had been photographed leaving the Whipple building seven times and reported at the scene of an immigration arrest weeks earlier. When one of the men approached the register holding a white Minnesota plate, Metrailer said she told him that the store had a new policy against selling the items.Metrailer said she had reported the incident to Minnesota’s attorney general. A spokesperson for DHS did not respond to a request for comment. \n    \n        \n    \n\nA response to obstruction Supporters of the immigration crackdown say the volunteer army of ICE-tracking activists in Minneapolis has forced federal agents to adopt new methods of avoiding detection. “Of course agents are adapting their tactics so that they’re a step ahead,” said Scott Mechkowski, former deputy director of ICE enforcement and operations in New York City. “We’ve never seen this level of obstruction and interference.”In nearly three decades in immigration enforcement, Mechkowski said he also hadn’t seen ICE agent disguising themselves as uniformed workers in the course of making arrests. Earlier this summer, a spokesperson for DHS confirmed a man wearing a high-visibility construction vest was an ICE agent conducting surveillance. In Oregon, a natural gas company published guidance last month on how customers could identify their employees after reports of federal impersonators. In the days since his encounter, Ramirez, the restaurant worker, said he has been on high alert for undercover agents. He recently stopped a locksmith who he feared might be a federal agent, before quickly realizing he was a local resident. “Everybody is on edge about these guys, man,” Ramirez said. “It feels like they’re everywhere.”\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JAKE OFFENHARTZ\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Offenhartz is a general assignment reporter in the New York City bureau of The Associated Press.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto\n    \n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n                    \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n                    \n    获取更多RSS：https://feedx.net https://feedx.site",

(AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File)2026-02-08T12:31:50Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump wants to keep home prices high, bypassing calls to ramp up construction so people can afford what has been a ticket to the middle class.Trump has instead argued for protecting existing owners who have watched the values of their homes climb. It’s a position that flies in the face of what many economists, the real estate industry, local officials and apartment dwellers say is needed to fix a big chunk of America’s affordability problem.“I don’t want to drive housing prices down. I want to drive housing prices up for people that own their homes, and they can be assured that’s what’s going to happen,” Trump told his Cabinet on Jan. 29.That approach could bolster the Republican president’s standing with older voters, a group that over time has been more likely to vote in midterm elections. Those races in November will determine whether Trump’s party can retain control of the House and Senate.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“You have a lot of people that have become wealthy in the last year because their house value has gone up,” Trump said. “And you know, when you get the housing — when you make it too easy and too cheap to buy houses — those values come down.”\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nBut by catering to older baby boomers on housing, Trump risks alienating the younger voters who expanded his coalition in 2024 and helped him win a second term, and he could wade into a “generational war” in the midterms, said Brent Buchanan, whose polling firm Cygnal advises Republicans. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“The under-40 group is the most important right now — they are the ones who put Trump in the White House,” Buchanan said. “Their desire to show up in an election or not is going to make the difference in this election. If they feel that Donald Trump is taking care of the boomers at their expense, that is going to hurt Republicans.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe logic in appealing to older votersIn the 2024 presidential election, 81% of Trump’s voters were homeowners, according to AP VoteCast data. This means many of his supporters already have mortgages with low rates or own their homes outright, possibly blunting the importance of housing as an issue.Older voters tend to show up to vote more than do younger people, said Oscar Pocasangre, a senior data analyst at liberal think tank New America who has studied the age divide in U.S. politics. “However, appealing to older voters may prove to be a misguided policy if what’s needed to win is to expand the voting base,” Pocasangre said.Before the 2026 elections, voters have consistently rated affordability as a top concern, and that is especially true for younger voters with regard to housing.Booker Lightman, 30, a software engineer in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, who identifies politically as a libertarian Republican, said the shortage of housing has been a leading problem in his state.Lightman just closed on a home last month, and while he and his wife, Alice, were able to manage the cost, he said that the lack of construction is pushing people out of Colorado. “There’s just not enough housing supply,” he said.Shay Hata, a real estate agent in the Chicago and Denver areas, said she handles about 100 to 150 transactions a year. But she sees the potential for a lot more. “We have a lack of inventory to the point where most properties, particularly in the suburbs, are getting between five and 20 offers,” she said, describing what she sees in the Chicago area.\n    \n        \n    \n\nNew construction could help more people afford homes because in some cases, buyers qualify for discounted mortgage rates from the builders’ preferred lenders, Hata said. She called the current situation “very discouraging for buyers because they’re getting priced out of the market.”But pending construction has fallen under Trump. Permits to build single-family homes have plunged 9.4% over the past 12 months in October, the most recent month available, to an annual rate of 876,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.Trump’s other ideas to help people buy housesTrump has not always been against increasing housing supply. During the 2024 campaign, Trump’s team said he would create tax breaks for homebuyers, trim regulations on construction, open up federal land for housing developments and make monthly payments more manageable by cutting mortgage rates. Advisers also claimed that housing stock would open up because of Trump’s push for mass deportations of people who were in the United States illegally.\n    \n        \n    \n\nAs recently as October, Trump urged builders to ramp up construction. “They’re sitting on 2 Million empty lots, A RECORD. I’m asking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to get Big Homebuilders going and, by so doing, help restore the American Dream!” Trump posted on social media, referring to the government-backed lenders.But more recently, he has been unequivocal on not wanting to pursue policies that would boost supply and lower prices. In office, Trump has so far focused his housing policy on lobbying the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rates. He believes that would make mortgages more affordable, although critics say it could spur higher inflation. Trump announced that the two mortgage companies, which are under government conservatorship, would buy at least $200 billion in home loan securities in a bid to reduce rates.\n    \n        \n    \n\nTrump also wants Congress to ban large financial institutions from buying homes. But he has rejected suggestions for expanding rules to let buyers use 401(k) retirement accounts for down payments, telling reporters that he did not want people to take their money out of the stock market because it was doing so well.There are signs that lawmakers in both parties see the benefits of taking steps to add houses before this year’s elections. There are efforts in the Senate and House to jump-start construction through the use of incentives to change zoning restrictions, among other policies.One of the underlying challenges on affordability is that home prices have been generally rising faster than incomes for several years.This makes it harder to save for down payments or upgrade to a nicer home. It also means that the places where people live increasingly double as their key financial asset, one that leaves many families looking moneyed on paper even if they are struggling with monthly bills.There is another risk for Trump. If the economy grows this year, as he has promised, that could push up demand for houses — as well as their prices — making the affordability problem more pronounced, said Edward Pinto, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank.Pinto said construction of single-family homes would have to rise by 50% to 100% during the next three years for average home price gains to be flat — a sign, he said, that Trump’s fears about falling home prices were probably unwarranted.“It’s very hard to crater home prices,” Pinto said.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JOSH BOAK\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Boak covers the White House and economic policy for The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ty ONeil)2026-02-08T16:28:35Z\n                                        TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — The urgent investigation into the apparent kidnapping of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie continued Sunday, a week after the mother of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie was reported missing in Arizona.Savannah Guthrie solemnly told the potential kidnappers in a social media video released Saturday that the family was prepared to pay for her safe return. Flanked by her siblings, Guthrie said “we received your message” and that: “This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.”An FBI spokesman said Savannah Guthrie was referring to a message that was sent to the Tucson-based television station KOLD on Friday. The station declined to share details about the message’s contents as the FBI conducted its review.Investigators believe Nancy Guthrie was taken against her will from her home just outside Tucson last weekend. DNA tests showed blood on Guthrie’s front porch was a match to her, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has said.\n    \n        \n    \n\nMultiple press outlets have received alleged ransom letters during the past week. At least one letter made monetary demands and established Thursday evening and Monday evening as deadlines. Law enforcement officials declined to affirm that the letters were credible but said all tips were being investigated seriously.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe sheriff and his staff did not respond to requests for updates Sunday morning.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nA FBI spokesman said Sunday that the investigation was continuing.The disappearance of the well-known TV host’s mother has fixated Americans over the past week. Candles remained lit early Sunday near Nancy Guthrie’s home, next to a sign expressing support for the family.The White House said President Donald Trump called and spoke with Savannah Guthrie last week. The president told reporters on Friday that there are clues in the case “that I think are very strong.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nAuthorities say they have growing concerns about Nancy Guthrie’s health because she needs daily medication. She is said to have a pacemaker and has dealt with high blood pressure and heart issues, according to sheriff’s dispatcher audio on broadcastify.com.The video released Saturday was the third this week that pleaded with potential kidnappers.",

        "title": "‘Melania’ falls steeply and ‘Send Help’ holds steady at No. 1 on a quiet weekend in theaters",
        "text": "A movie theater puts up a poster for the screening of a documentary about Melania Trump, in Ljubljana, Slovenia, Friday, Jan. 30, 2026. (AP Photo/Darko Bandic)2026-02-08T18:00:47Z\n                                        NEW YORK (AP) — Hollywood largely ceded attention to football over a slow box-office weekend, with the survival thriller “Send Help” repeating as No. 1 in ticket sales and the Melania Trump documentary “Melania” falling sharply in its second weekend. Super Bowl weekend is typically one of the lowest attended moviegoing times of the year. It was the second slowest weekend last year and in 2024 it ranked dead last for moviegoing. Studios instead put their focus on advertising movies for the massive television audience. Among the trailers expected to hit the NFL broadcast Sunday were The Walt Disney Co.'s “Mandalorian and Grogu,” Lionsgate’s Michael Jackson biopic, “Michael” and Universal Pictures’ “The Super Mario Galaxy Movie.” In North American theaters, the Disney.-20th Century Studios release “Send Help,” directed by Sam Raimi, lead all films with $10 million in its second weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. With $53.7 million globally thus far, the R-rated survival thriller has proved a solid midbudget success. Disney meanwhile watched its remarkably long-lasting “Zootopia 2\" cross $1.8 billion worldwide in its 11th week of release. \n    \n        \n    \n\n“Melania,” from Amazon MGM, added 300 theaters in its second weekend but dropped steeply with to $2.4 million in ticket sales, down 67% from its much-discussed debut. The rapid downturn means the Brett Ratner-directed documentary is likely heading toward flop territory given its high price tag. Amazon MGM paid $40 million for film rights, plus some $35 million to market it. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe North American total for “Melania” stands at $13.4 million. Amazon MGM has not released international figures, though they’re expected to be paltry. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nKevin Wilson, head of domestic distribution for the studio, said the movie’s box-office performance “is a critical first moment that validates our wholistic distribution strategy, building awareness, engagement, and provides momentum ahead of the film’s eventual debut on Prime Video.” \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe film’s ticket sales — which would be very good for a less expensive documentary — were a talking point throughout the week. Late-night hosts Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel hammered the movie’s sales. Kimmel called them a “rigged outcome.” Elsewhere in theaters, the Italy-set Kevin James romantic comedy “Solo Mio” debuted with a robust $7.2 million, a major win for the Christian-oriented Angel Studios. “Stray Kinds: The Dominate Experience,” a K-pop concert film released by Bleecker Street, launched with $5.6 million. The Luc Besson-directed Bram Stoker adaptation “Dracula” opened with $4.5 million, a studio-best debut for the indie distributor Vertical. One of the most unusual releases in theaters, however, remains the low-budget indie “Iron Lung.” The YouTube filmmaker Markiplier, whose real name is Mark Fischbach, self-financed and self-distributed the R-rated video game adaptation, along with writing, directing and starring in it.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)2026-02-08T13:46:51Z\n                                        NEW YORK (AP) — Paul Thomas Anderson won the top prize at the 78th Directors Guild Awards, putting the “One Battle After Another” filmmaker on course to potentially win his first Oscar.The DGA Awards, held Saturday night at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, is among the most reliable Academy Awards precursors. In the last 10 years, nine DGA winners have gone on to win best director at the Oscars. In the guild’s nearly eight-decade history, only eight times has the guild not predicted the Oscar winner.The award adds to a virtual awards-season sweep for “One Battle After Another,” which has won with critics groups, the Gotham Awards and the Golden Globes. It’s considered the favorite for best picture at the March 15 Oscars. Academy voting begins Feb. 26.The other nominees were Ryan Coogler (“Sinners”), Guillermo Del Toro (“Frankenstein”), Josh Safdie (“Marty Supreme”) and Chloé Zhao (“Hamnet”).\n    \n        \n    \n\nAs he’s often done through awards season, Anderson in his brief speech paid tribute to late assistant director Adam Somner, who died in 2024. “Obviously,” he said, “we are up here minus one.”\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe awards, hosted by Kumail Nanjiani, were the first presided over by n ew Directors Guild of America president Christopher Nolan. He began the ceremony acknowledging “very hard times” for filmmakers.“In 2024, our employment in our guild was down about 40%, and that was followed by another decline in ’25,” said Nolan. “The amount of money that people spend on our work, on entertainment, is very, very stable. Audiences are invested in us, we have to be sure that we’re able to repay that investment.”Other winners Saturday included “The Plague” filmmaker Charlie Polinger for first-time director; “2000 Meters to Andriivka” director Mstyslav Chernov for best documentary filmmaking; and “The Studio” directors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg for comedy series.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JAKE COYLE\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Coyle has been a film critic and covered the movie industry for The Associated Press since 2013.

        "text": "SummaryUniversal Pictures released the first full-length trailer for Steven Spielberg’s Disclosure Day during Super Bowl LXThe film stars Emily Blunt as a meteorologist caught in a global event involving the revelation of extraterrestrial lifeSet for a June 12, 2026 release, the movie marks a reunion for Spielberg with screenwriter David Koepp and composer John WilliamsSteven Spielberg has officially returned to the genre that defined his career. During the Super Bowl on Sunday, Universal Pictures unveiled the extensive new trailer for Disclosure Day, a high-stakes sci-fi thriller that envisions humanity’s first contact with alien life not as a secret invasion, but as a breaking news event. Starring Emily Blunt and Josh O’Connor, the film poses a terrifying question to its audience, \"If you found out we weren't alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you?\" The spot teased a chaotic, ground-level view of a world grappling with the sudden confirmation of extraterrestrial existence.The trailer centers on Emily Blunt’s character, a Kansas City TV meteorologist who becomes an unlikely conduit for the \"disclosure.\" Footage shows her unraveling on live television, muttering strange sounds and appearing possessed by an unseen force, sparking a global frenzy. Parallel to her story is Josh O’Connor’s character, who is depicted as a whistleblower desperate to release government material long shrouded in secrecy. \"Full disclosure to the whole world. All at once,\" he declares in the clip, setting the stage for a race against time to reveal the truth to seven billion people.Visually, the film promises the kind of spectacle Spielberg is known for. The Super Bowl spot featured heart-pounding set pieces, including a sequence where Blunt and O’Connor jump from a moving train and a glimpse of a massive UFO emerging through the clouds. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with Colin Firth shown strapped to a chair undergoing a terrifying transformation, alongside appearances by Colman Domingo, Eve Hewson, and Wyatt Russell. The screenplay is penned by David Koepp, marking his first collaboration with Spielberg since War of the Worlds (2005) and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008).The project is being positioned as a major cinematic event, not just for its subject matter but for its creative team. In addition to Koepp’s script, the film features a score by legendary composer John Williams, extending their historic 50-year partnership. With a plot that blends the awe of Close Encounters of the Third Kind with the modern paranoia of a post-truth world, Disclosure Day aims to be the definitive blockbuster of the summer.Check out the trailer above. Disclosure Day arrives in theaters worldwide on June 12, 2026.Read more at Hypebeast",

Ditching her signature gothic aesthetic, the \"Die with a Smile\" singer stepped onto the stage in a baby blue flamenco-inspired dress designed by Dominican-American designer Raul Lopez. The performance highlighted a cultural fusion between the two icons, further cemented by Gaga's meticulously chosen accessories.Designed by the 2024 CFDA Designer of the Year, the bespoke LUAR ensemble utilized a specific shade of azul celeste, a nod to the original 1895 Puerto Rican flag. The silhouette featured a plunging neckline and an intricate stitched waist, flowing into a tiered, voluminous skirt that allowed for fluid movement during the duo's high-energy choreography. The outfit was styled by Chloe and Chenelle Delgadillo, the duo balanced the garment’s traditional cultural references with a modern, high-fashion execution suitable for the Levi's Stadium stage.The most poignant detail of the ensemble was the Flor de Maga pinned to Gaga’s hair — a vibrant red hibiscus that serves as the national flower of Puerto Rico. Custom-designed by Piers Atkinson, the floral piece provided a sharp contrast to the blue fabric and coordinated with Gaga’s red manicure and heels. This styling choice underscored the halftime show’s overarching theme of Latin resilience and community, elevating her co-star’s heritage.&nbsp;View this post on Instagram&nbsp;A post shared by HYPEBEAST (@hypebeast)Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

On Sunday, the Puerto Rican icon was spotted wearing a stunning Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Selfwinding, Reference 15553BA.OO.1356BA.04. Known for his bold style choices, the artist selected a timepiece that perfectly balances the industrial heritage of the Royal Oak with the organic beauty of natural stone, adding a layer of sophisticated luxury to his stage presence.The 37 mm model is defined by its rich material contrast. The case and signature integrated bracelet are crafted entirely from 18-carat yellow gold, offering a classic, warm luster that stood out under the stadium lights. The gold construction extends to the hands and hour-markers, which are filled with luminescent material for visibility, as well as the gold-toned inner bezel.The true centerpiece of the watch, however, is its natural malachite dial. Celebrating the artistry of stone dials, this feature brings unique texture and depth to the collection's iconic design. The vibrant green of the malachite, with its natural banding and striations, creates a striking visual counterpoint to the sharp, geometric lines of the yellow gold case, making the piece as much a work of art as it is a timekeeping instrument.

While fans speculated he might wear Schiaparelli or Jacquemus, the global superstar took the stage in Santa Clara wearing a monochromatic cream aesthetic that blended sportswear with sharp tailoring. Styled by his longtime collaborators Storm Pablo and Marvin Douglas Linares, the outfit served as a grounded, accessible fashion statement that honored his roots while commanding the massive scale of the event.The centerpiece of the performance look was a boxy, football-inspired jersey layered over a crisp collared shirt and tie. The back of the jersey read \"OCASIO 64,\" a deeply personal detail referencing his mother’s surname, Lysaurie Ocasio, and her birth year, 1964. 1964 was also a memorable year in Puerto Rico as the year also saw the establishment of the U.S.-Puerto Rico Commission on the Status of Puerto Rico, examining the island's political status. This tribute was paired with matching cream chinos and moto-inspired gloves, creating a silhouette that felt both athletic and formal. On his feet, he debuted an all-white pair of his signature adidas BadBo 1.0 sneakers, cementing his ongoing partnership with the sportswear giant.Midway through the set, as the energy shifted for a guest appearance by Lady Gaga, Bad Bunny executed a subtle costume change. He shed the \"Ocasio\" jersey to reveal a tailored suit jacket, instantly transforming the vibe from stadium concert to an elegant, \"Old San Juan\" wedding party aesthetic. The versatility of the custom Zara pieces allowed him to navigate the show's diverse setlist—from the high-energy \"Tití Me Preguntó\" to the collaborative \"Baile Inolvidable\"—without missing a beat.Bad Bunny’s choice to wear Zara on the world’s biggest stage marks a significant moment for the brand, proving that accessible fashion can stand toe-to-toe with couture under the Super Bowl lights.&nbsp;View this post on Instagram&nbsp;A post shared by HYPEBEAST (@hypebeast)Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

During the second quarter of Super Bowl LX, Universal Pictures and Nintendo unveiled the extensive new trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, the highly anticipated sequel to their 2023 billion-dollar smash hit. The high-octane spot offered audiences their first proper introduction to the franchise's expanded universe, confirming long-standing rumors that Academy Award winner Brie Larson has joined the ensemble as the beloved Princess Rosalina. Alongside her debut, the trailer teased a chaotic new dynamic for the Koopa family, with acclaimed director and actor Benny Safdie lending his voice to the bratty, paintbrush-wielding Bowser Jr.The trailer opens with a familiar comedic beat from Chris Pratt’s Mario before quickly shifting gears into a visual spectacle of spherical worlds and zero-gravity platforming. Key sequences show the plumber navigating the \"Star Festival\" before being launched into the cosmos. The centerpiece of the footage is the reveal of the Comet Observatory, home to Rosalina and her Lumas. Larson’s voice performance is teased as regal yet commanding, a stark contrast to the frantic energy of the Mario Bros., as she warns the heroes that \"the fabric of the universe is unraveling.\"On the villainous side, Jack Black returns as Bowser, but he is joined by a new, unpredictable threat. Benny Safdie voices Bowser Jr., who is shown piloting a massive mech suit—a nod to the \"Megaleg\" boss fight from the 2007 video game. The trailer highlights Safdie’s unique vocal take on the character, blending petulance with a surprising tactical menace. The footage also confirms the return of fan-favorites Anya Taylor-Joy (Peach), Charlie Day (Luigi), and Keegan-Michael Key (Toad), all of whom are donning space suits for the adventure.Directed by returning filmmakers Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, the sequel appears to be doubling down on the deep-cut fan service that defined the first film. The trailer is packed with references to the Wii-era Galaxy games, including Launch Stars, Star Bits, and a glimpse of a gravitational mechanic that allows Mario to run upside down. With animation that pushes the studio’s technical boundaries, the film is positioned as the marquee family blockbuster of the spring season.Check out the new trailer above.

        "text": "Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz listens as President Donald Trump speaks about TrumpRx in the South Court Auditorium in the Old Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House campus, Thursday, Feb. 5, 2026, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)2026-02-08T20:05:54Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — A leading U.S. health official on Sunday urged people to get inoculated against the measles at a time of outbreaks across several states and as the United States is at risk of losing its measles elimination status.“Take the vaccine, please,” said Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator whose boss has raised suspicion about the safety and importance of vaccines. “We have a solution for our problem.”Oz, a heart surgeon, defended some recently revised federal vaccine recommendations as well as past comments from President Donald Trump and the nation’s health chief, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., about the efficacy of vaccines. From Oz, there was a clear message on the measles.“Not all illnesses are equally dangerous and not all people are equally susceptible to those illnesses,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “But measles is one you should get your vaccine.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nAn outbreak in South Carolina in the hundreds has surpassed the recorded case count in Texas’ 2025 outbreak, and there is also one on the Utah-Arizona border. Multiple other states have had confirmed cases this year. The outbreaks have mostly impacted children and have come as infectious disease experts warn that rising public distrust of vaccines generally may be contributing to the spread of a disease once declared eradicated by public health officials.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nAsked in the television interview whether people should fear the measles, Oz replied, “Oh, for sure.” He said Medicare and Medicaid will continue to cover the measles vaccine as part of the insurance programs.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“There will never be a barrier to Americans get access to the measles vaccine. And it is part of the core schedule,” Oz said.But Oz also said “we have advocated for measles vaccines all along” and that Kennedy “has been on the very front of this.”Questions about vaccines did not come up later in a Kennedy interview on Fox News Channel’s “The Sunday Briefing,” where he was asked about what kind of Super Bowl snack he might have (probably yogurt). He also he eats steak with sauerkraut in the mornings.\n    \n        \n    \n\nCritics of Kennedy have argued that the health secretary’s longtime skepticism of U.S. vaccine recommendations and past sympathy for the unfounded claim that vaccines may cause autism may influence official public health guidance in ways contrary to the medical consensus. Oz argued that Kennedy’s stance was supportive of the measles vaccine despite Kennedy’s general comments about the recommended vaccine schedule.“When the first outbreak happened in Texas, he said, get your vaccines for measles, because that’s an example of an ailment that you should get vaccinated against,” Oz said.The Republican administration last month dropped some vaccine recommendations for children, an overhaul of the traditional vaccine schedule that the Department of Health and Human Services said was in response to a request from Trump.Trump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.\n    \n        \n    \n\nStates, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While federal requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the administration’s guidance on vaccines.U.S. vaccination rates have dropped and the share of children with exemptions has reached an all-time high, according to federal data. At the same time, rates of diseases that can be protected against with vaccines, such as measles and whooping cough, are rising across the country.Kennedy’s past anti-vaccine activismKennedy’s past skepticism of vaccines has come under scrutiny since Trump first nominated him to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.During his Senate confirmation testimony last year, Kennedy told lawmakers that a closely scrutinized 2019 trip he took to Samoa, which came before a devastating measles outbreak, had “nothing to do with vaccines.”But documents obtained by The Guardian and The Associated Press undermine that testimony. Emails sent by staffers at the U.S. Embassy and the United Nations said that Kennedy sought to meet with top Samoan officials during his trip to the Pacific island nation. Samoan officials later said Kennedy’s trip bolstered the credibility of anti-vaccine activists before the measles outbreak, which sickened thousands of people and killed 83, mostly children under age 5.\n    \n        \n    \n\nMixed messaging on autism, vaccinesOz’s comments mark a broader pattern among administration officials of voicing discordant and at times contradictory statements about the efficacy of vaccines amid an overhaul of U.S. public health policy. Officials have walked a fine line in criticizing past U.S. vaccine policy, often at times appearing to express sympathy for unfounded conspiracy theories from anti-vaccine activists, while also not straying too far from established science. During a Senate hearing Tuesday, Jay Bhattacharya, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said no single vaccine causes autism, but he did not rule out the possibility that research may find some combination of vaccines could have negative health side effects.\n    \n        \n    \n\nBut Kennedy, in Senate testimony, has argued that a link between vaccines and autism has not been disproved.He has previously claimed that some components of vaccines, like the mercury-containing preservative thimerosal, may cause childhood neurological disorders such as autism. Most vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella do not contain thimerosal. A federal vaccine advisory board overhauled by Kennedy last year voted to no longer recommend thimerosal-containing vaccines.Administration public health officials often cite the need to restore trust in public health systems after the coronavirus pandemic, when vaccine policy and the general public health response to the deadly pandemic became a highly polarizing topic in American politics. Misinformation and conspiracy theories about the public health system also spread during the pandemic, and longtime anti-vaccine activist groups saw a swell in interest from the wider public.Kennedy, who for years led the anti-vaccine activist group Children’s Health Defense, has been criticized for ordering reviews of vaccines and public health guidelines that leading medical research groups have deemed settled science.Public health experts also criticized the president for making unfounded claims about highly politicized health issues. During a September Oval Office event, Trump asserted without evidence that Tylenol and vaccines are linked to a rise in the incidence of autism in the United States.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                MATT BROWN\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Brown covers national politics, federal policy and democracy issues for The Associated Press.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        instagram\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto",

Engineers have developed a new type of perovskite material arranged into an ordered \"supercrystal.\" In this structure, tiny packets of energy called excitons work together rather than individually, allowing the material to amplify light far more efficiently. The findings, published in Laser & Photonics Reviews, could have applications in communications, sensors, and computing, improving the performance of devices that rely on light, such as sensors in autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, or electronics.",
