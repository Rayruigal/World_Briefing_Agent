        "text": "Freight trucks travel northbound on Interstate 5 Highway, Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2025, in Tracy, Calif. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. Vásquez, File)2026-02-20T19:23:45Z\n                                        All truckers and pass drivers will have to take their commercial driver’s license tests in English as the Trump administration expands its aggressive campaign to improve safety in the industry and get unqualified drivers off the road.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the latest effort Friday to ensure that drivers understand English well enough to read road signs and communicate with law enforcement officers. Florida already started administering its tests in English.Currently, many states allow drivers to take their license tests in other languages even though they are required to demonstrate English proficiency. California offered tests in 20 other languages. And Duffy said that a number of states have hired other companies to administer commercial driver’s licenses tests, and those companies aren’t enforcing the standards that drivers are supposed to meet.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“And the third party tester is participating in the scam because they are not adequately testing the people who went through a sham school,” Duffy said.He said every American wants drivers who get behind the wheel of a big rig to be well-qualified to handle those vehicles. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe campaign will also now expand to go prevent fraudulent trucking companies from getting into the business while continuing to go after questionable schools and ensure states are complying with all the regulations for handing out commercial licenses.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nEarlier this week, the Transportation Department said 557 driving schools should close because they failed to meet basic safety standards. And the department has been aggressively going after states that handed out commercial driver’s licenses to immigrants who shouldn’t have qualified for them ever since a fatal crash in August. A truck driver who Duffy says wasn’t authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. Other fatal crashes since then, including one in Indiana that killed four earlier this month, have only heightened concerns.\n    \n        \n    \n\nDuffy said that the registration system and requirements for trucking companies will be strengthened while Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration inspectors conduct more spot checks of trucks and commercial driver’s license schools.Currently, companies only have to pay a few hundred dollars and show proof of insurance to get registered to operate, and then they might not be audited until a year or more later. That has made it easy for fraudulent companies that are known in the industry as chameleon carriers to register multiple times under different names and then simply switch names and registration numbers to avoid any consequences after crashes or other violations.Officials are also trying to make sure that the electronic logging devices drivers use are accurate, and that states are following all the regulations to ensure drivers are qualified to get commercial licenses. After that Indiana crash, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration knocked the company that employed the driver out of service and pulled the DOT numbers assigned to two other companies that were linked to AJ Partners. Tutash Express and Sam Express in the Chicago area were also disqualified, and the Aydana driving school that the trucker involved in the crash attended lost its certification. \n    \n        \n    \n\nImmigration authorities arrested that driver, Bekzhan Beishekeev from Kyrgystan because the 30-year old entered the country illegally. Authorities say he pulled out and tried to go around a truck that had slowed in front of him and his truck slammed into an oncoming van. In December, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration took action to decertify up to 7,500 of the 16,000 schools nationwide but that included many defunct operations. Duffy said the companies involved in that Indiana crash were all registered at the same apartment. In other cases there might be hundreds of companies registered at a single address. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JOSH FUNK\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Funk is an Associated Press reporter who covers transportation including aviation safety and airlines along with all the major freight railroads.

        "text": "President Donald Trump speaks during a breakfast with the National Governors Association in the State Dining Room of the White House, Friday, Feb. 20, 2026, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)2026-02-20T16:35:18Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump paid a price for going it alone on tariffs — with the Supreme Court on Friday delivering a rare rebuke by ruling he lacked the power to declare an economic emergency and launch sweeping new taxes on imports.Trump had made tariffs the bedrock of his economic pitch to voters going into the midterm elections, even describing tariffs as his “favorite word in the dictionary.” He promised that factories would relocate from overseas and bring jobs with them, and he warned that losing the tariffs could plunge the U.S. into a deep recession.But Friday’s ruling will most likely prolong political and economic chaos over international trade through the election year.Trump called the decision “a disgrace” when he was told of the news during a private meeting with several governors, according to a person with direct knowledge of the president’s reaction who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n    \n        \n    \n\nRepublican strategist Doug Heye said it was immediately clear that the president “is not going to be happy” about the decision.“We’re starting to hear about how this is a massive blow, a massive repudiation,” he said.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nHowever, Heye said Trump will try to find another way to pursue his trade agenda. “Are they going to be able to figure out how to use this as an opportunity or not?” he asked. “There are too many questions.”The White House plans to use alternative laws to preserve his tariffs, but those policies will only prolong the debate and keep alive an issue that is largely unpopular with voters.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nAbout 6 in 10 Americans said Trump had gone too far on imposing new tariffs on other countries, according to an AP-NORC poll from January.Even more worrisome for a president elected on the promise of fixing Americans’ concerns about affordability, 76% said in a poll conducted last April that Trump’s tariff policies would increase the cost of consumer goods in the U.S.\n    \n        \n    \n\nDemocrats were quick to seize on the opportunity given to them by the Supreme Court, with Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., saying that Trump “is not a king” and his “tariffs were always illegal.”“Republicans in Congress could have easily ended this economic crisis by standing up for their communities,” said DelBene, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “Instead, they chose to bend the knee to Trump while families, small businesses, and farmers suffered from higher prices.”The ruling essentially allows Democrats to say that Trump broke the law and that middle class families suffered as a result.But Trump has claimed that his tariffs were the difference between national prosperity and deep poverty, a pitch he made on Thursday night to voters in the swing state of Georgia.The president used the word “tariff” 28 times in his speech Thursday at a Georgia steel company, Coosa Steel, which credited the import taxes as making its products more competitive with goods from China.“Without tariffs, this country would be in such trouble right now,” Trump charged.Trump also complained that he had to justify his use of tariffs to the Supreme Court.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“I have to wait for this decision. I’ve been waiting forever, forever, and the language is clear that I have the right to do it as president,” he said. “I have the right to put tariffs on for national security purposes, countries that have been ripping us off for years.” By a 6-3 vote, the high court said no.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JOSH BOAK\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Boak covers the White House and economic policy for The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew)2026-02-20T05:21:51Z\n                                        \n    \n    ▶ Follow the latest updates on the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down President Trump’s tariffs\n    \n\nNEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are ticking higher Friday after the Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, which had triggered panic in financial markets when announced last year.The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.6%. It had been flipping between small gains and losses earlier in the morning following discouraging reports showing slowing growth for the U.S. economy and faster inflation.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 124 points, or 0.3%, as of 11 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.1% higher. Many on Wall Street were likely expecting such a ruling from the Supreme Court, according to Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management. That likely led to the relatively muted reactions across financial markets.Treasury yields edged only a bit higher in the bond market. Stock indexes in Europe added some to their gains from earlier in the day, while the U.S. dollar’s value edged down against the euro and other currencies.\n    \n        \n    \n\nGold’s price slipped from nearly $5,075 per ounce just before the ruling toward $5,000 before climbing back. It had surged to records earlier this year in part on worries about the uncertainty Trump’s tariffs created for businesses and households worldwide. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nDespite the Supreme Court’s blocking Trump from levying sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs on nearly every country in the world, tariffs may not be going away. Jacobsen said he expects Trump’s White House to shift strategy and use tariffs that target specific countries or industries. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“This will give some short-lived relief as it just delays the inevitable of tariffs from a different authority,” he said.Heading into the day, the main event for markets had seemed to be the discouraging reports showing slowing U.S. economic growth and accelerating inflation. But they also found a relatively muted response from investors. While the data underscored the tricky situation the Federal Reserve faces as it sets interest rates, they did not change traders’ expectations much for what the Fed will ultimately do. \n    \n        \n    \n\nFollowing the reports, traders are still mostly betting that the Fed will lower rates at least twice by the end of this year, according to data from CME Group. Some shifted bets for the timing of when the cuts could begin to slightly later in the summer. Lower interest rates would give the economy a boost, but they also risk worsening inflation. Fed officials said at their last meeting that they want to see inflation fall further  before they would support cutting rates further.The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.09% from 4.08% late Thursday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, inched up to 3.48% from 3.47%. On Wall Street, Akamai Technologies dropped 9.3% for one of the market’s sharpest losses. The cybersecurity and cloud computing company reported stronger results for the end of 2025 than analysts expected, but it gave a profit forecast for the upcoming year that fell short of estimates. Akamai plans to spend a bigger percentage of its revenue this upcoming year on equipment and other investments. It’s the latest potential indicator of how higher prices for computer memory amid shortages created by the AI boom is affecting customers throughout the economy. \n    \n        \n    \n\nOn the winning side of the market was Comfort Systems, which rose 4.3% after the provider of heating, ventilation air conditioning and electrical services reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Brian Lane said his company is seeing “unprecedented demand.”In stock markets abroad, indexes rose in Europe following a more mixed finish in Asia. The Hang Seng fell 1.1% after Hong Kong’s market reopened following Lunar New Year holidays, but South Korea’s Kospi jumped 2.3% to a record, led by major defense contractors like Hanwha Aerospace. The company is one of many benefiting from a ramp up in military spending in many countries. ___AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.",

        "title": "Trump has other tariff options after Supreme Court strikes down his worldwide import taxes",
        "text": "The Supreme Court is photographed, Feb. 6, 2026, in Washington. (AP Photo/Rahmat Gul, File)2026-02-20T16:10:51Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump still has options to keep taxing imports aggressively even after the Supreme Court struck down the tariffs he imposed last year on nearly every country on earth.The Justices didn’t buy the president’s sweeping claims of authority to impose tariffs as he sees fit. But Trump can re-use tariff powers he deployed in his first term and can reach for others, including one that dates back to the Great Depression.“It’s hard to see any pathway here where tariffs end,” said Georgetown trade law professor Kathleen Claussen. “I am pretty convinced he could rebuild the tariff landscape he has now using other authorities.”Trump had claimed nearly boundless authority to impose tariffs under 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). But opponents argued before the Supreme Court that that power wasn’t necessary because Congress delegated tariff power to the White House in several other statutes — though it carefully limited the ways the president could use the authority. \n    \n        \n    \n\nTariffs have been a cornerstone of Trump’s foreign and economic policy in his second term, with double-digit “reciprocal” tariffs imposed on most countries, which he has justified by declaring America’s longstanding trade deficits a national emergency. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe average U.S. tariff has gone from 2.5% when Trump returned to the White House in January to nearly 17% a year later, the highest since 1934, according to calculations by Yale University’s Budget Lab.The president acted alone even though the U.S. Constitution specifically gives the power to tax – and impose tariffs – to Congress.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nCountering unfair trade practicesThe United States has long had a handy cudgel to wallop countries it accuses of engaging in “unjustifiable,” “unreasonable” or “discriminatory” trade practices. That is Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.And Trump has made aggressive use of it himself — especially against China. In his first term, he cited Section 301 to impose sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports in a dispute over the sharp-elbowed tactics that Beijing was using to challenge America’s technological dominance. The U.S. is also using 301 powers to counter what it calls unfair Chinese practices in the shipbuilding industry.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThere are no limits on the size of Section 301 tariffs. They expire after four years but can be extended.But the administration’s trade representative must conduct an investigation and typically hold a public hearing before imposing 301 tariffs.Experts have said Section 301 is useful in taking on China. But it has drawbacks when it comes to dealing with the smaller countries that Trump has hammered with reciprocal tariffs. “Undertaking dozens and dozens of 301 investigations of all of those countries is a laborious process,” Veroneau said.Targeting trade deficitsIn striking down Trump’s reciprocal tariffs in May, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that the president couldn’t use emergency powers to combat trade deficits.That is partly because Congress had specifically given the White House limited authority to address the problem in another statute: Section 122, also of the Trade Act of 1974. That allows the president to impose tariffs of up to 15% for up to 150 days in response to unbalanced trade. The administration doesn’t even have to conduct an investigation beforehand.But Section 122 authority has never been used to apply tariffs, and there is some uncertainty about how it would work.\n    \n        \n    \n\nProtecting national securityIn both of his terms, Trump has made aggressive use of his power — under Section 232 of Trade Expansion Act of 1962 — to impose tariffs on imports that he deems a threat to national security.In 2018, he slapped tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, levies he’s expanded since returning to the White House. He also plastered Section 232 tariffs on autos, auto parts, copper, lumber. In September, the president even levied Section 232 tariffs on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered furniture. Section 232 tariffs are not limited by law but do require an investigation by the U.S. Commerce Department. It’s the administration itself that does the investigating – also true for Section 301 cases — “so they have a lot of control over the outcome,” Veroneau said.\n    \n        \n    \n\nReviving Depression-era tariffsNearly a century ago, with the U.S. and world economies in collapse, Congress passed the Tariff Act of 1930, imposing hefty taxes on imports. Known as the Smoot-Hawley tariffs (for their congressional sponsors), these levies have been widely condemned by economists and historians for limiting world commerce and making the Great Depression worse. They also got a memorable pop culture shoutout in the 1986 movie “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.”Section 338 of the law authorizes the president to impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that have discriminated against U.S. businesses. No investigation is required, and there’s no limit on how long the tariffs can stay in place.Those tariffs have never been imposed — U.S. trade negotiators traditionally have favored Section 301 sanctions instead — though the United States used the threat of them as a bargaining chip in trade talks in the 1930s.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIn September, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Reuters that the administration was considering Section 338 as a Plan B if the Supreme Court ruled against Trump’s use of emergency powers tariffs.____Associated Press Staff Writer Lindsay Whitehurst contributed to this story.",

        "text": "The Supreme Court is photographed, Feb. 6, 2026, in Washington. (AP Photo/Rahmat Gul, File)2026-02-20T15:07:12Z\n                                        \n    \n    ▶ Follow the latest updates on the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down President Trump’s tariffs\n    \n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump’s far-reaching global tariffs on Friday, handing him a significant loss on an issue crucial to his economic agenda. The 6-3 decision centers on tariffs imposed under an emergency powers law, including the sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs he levied on nearly every other country.It’s the first major piece of Trump’s broad agenda to come squarely before the nation’s highest court, which he helped shape with the appointments of three conservative jurists in his first term.The majority found that the Constitution “very clearly” gives Congress the power to impose taxes, which include tariffs. “The Framers did not vest any part of the taxing power in the Executive Branch,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote.  Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh dissented. \n    \n        \n    \n\n“The tariffs at issue here may or may not be wise policy. But as a matter of text, history, and precedent, they are clearly lawful,” Kavanaugh wrote in the dissent. The tariffs decision doesn’t stop Trump from imposing duties under other laws. While those have more limitations on the speed and severity of Trump’s actions, top administration officials have said they expect to keep the tariff framework in place under other authorities. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling comes despite a series of short-term wins on the court’s emergency docket that have allowed Trump to push ahead with extraordinary flexes of executive power on issues ranging from high-profile firings to major federal funding cuts.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe Republican president has been vocal about the case, calling it one of the most important in U.S. history and saying a ruling against him would be an economic body blow to the country. But legal opposition crossed the political spectrum, including libertarian and pro-business groups that are typically aligned with the GOP. Polling has found tariffs aren’t broadly popular with the public, amid wider voter concern about affordability.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe Constitution gives Congress the power to levy tariffs. But the Trump administration argued that a 1977 law allowing the president to regulate importation during emergencies also allows him to set tariffs. Other presidents have used the law dozens of times, often to impose sanctions, but Trump was the first president to invoke it for import taxes. Trump set what he called “reciprocal” tariffs on most countries in April 2025 to address trade deficits that he declared a national emergency. Those came after he imposed duties on Canada, China and Mexico, ostensibly to address a drug trafficking emergency.A series of lawsuits followed, including a case from a dozen largely Democratic-leaning states and others from small businesses selling everything from plumbing supplies to educational toys to women’s cycling apparel. The challengers argued the emergency powers law doesn’t even mention tariffs and Trump’s use of it fails several legal tests, including one that doomed then-President Joe Biden’s $500 billion student loan forgiveness program. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe economic impact of Trump’s tariffs has been estimated at some $3 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The Treasury has collected more than $133 billion from the import taxes the president has imposed under the emergency powers law, federal data from December shows. Many companies, including the big-box warehouse chain Costco, have already lined up in court to demand refunds.___Follow the AP’s coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                LINDSAY WHITEHURST\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Whitehurst covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs for The Associated Press.

        "text": "A shopper checks out at a cash register in a grocery store in Schaumburg, Ill., Monday, Feb. 9, 2026. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)2026-02-20T13:40:50Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — A key inflation gauge accelerated in December, a sign that many prices are still rising more quickly than most Americans would prefer — and faster than the Federal Reserve’s target of 2% a year.Prices rose 0.4% in December from the previous month, up from 0.2% in November, the Commerce Department said Friday in a report that was delayed by the six-week government shutdown last fall. Compared with a year ago, inflation rose 2.9% in December, up from 2.8% in November. Core prices — which exclude the volatile food and energy categories — also rose 0.4% in December from the previous month, up from 0.2% in November. Core prices jumped 3% in December from a year ago, faster than November’s 2.8% increase.The figures show that inflation remains elevated, even as it has come down from a peak near 7% in 2022. With many prices still rising more quickly than they did before the pandemic, the report points to a key reason that many Americans remain unhappy with the economy, even as unemployment remains low and growth is solid. Friday’s report also showed that consumers kept spending at a solid clip in December, when spending rose 0.4% from the previous month, the same as in November. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                CHRISTOPHER RUGABER\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Rugaber has covered the Federal Reserve and the U.S. economy for the AP for 16 years.

        "title": "What Depop’s $1B USD eBay Merge Means for Resale",
        "text": "On February 18, eBay announced a deal that would acquire mobile apparel resale platform Depop from Etsy for $1.2 billion USD. The big-ticket acquisition demonstrates the sheer value that the secondhand apparel market has accumulated, clocking in just short of the $1.3 billion USD price tag Prada Group paid to acquire luxury label Versace.\"Depop has built a trusted, social-forward marketplace with strong momentum in the pre-loved fashion category, and we are confident that as part of eBay, Depop will be even more well-positioned for long-term growth, benefiting from our scale, complementary offerings, and operational capabilities,\" said Jamie Ianonne, Chief Executive Officer of eBay, in the announcement.The release highlights Depop’s outstanding performance: the company reported annual gross merchandise sales (GMS) of $1 billion in 2025. But Depop isn’t the only company seeing success in resale. According to the annual resale report conducted by ThredUp, the global secondhand apparel market is expected to reach $367 billion by 2029, a forecast backedup by impressive performance. In 2024, online resale grew at its strongest rate since 2021, accounting for 88% of all resale spending. Ultimately, resale grew 8X faster than the retail clothing sector as a whole.So, why exactly did secondhand fashion turn into such a lucrative arm of the industry, and how is it evolving?What began as a diverse landscape of resale platforms emerging from the 2000s to the 2010s is slowly evolving into a landscape ruled by megaplatforms.Over the last decade or more, apparel resale has grown with the rise of digital platforms that have made both thrifting and consigning easily accessible to anybody remotely. Furthermore, factors like rising retail prices and degrading quality have driven many customers to platforms like Depop and eBay in search of not only better deals but better quality.While platforms like The RealReal and Fashionophile (originally an eBay storefront) focus more on luxury products, it's worth noting that the high-end resale arena has also grown alongside the general market.Luxury customers may have more spending power, but they’ve not been immune to the headwinds caused by inflation and tariffs. The “luxury slowdown” of 2024 was a sure sign. However, in conjunction with saving, a surging nostalgia for archival luxury could be attracting customers to these platforms as well. Grailed’s 2026 marketplace report showed that searches for Hedi Slimane’s archival eras at Dior Homme and Saint Laurent grew by +38%, alongside other designer names of the era like Giuseppe Zanotti (+253%) and Jeremy Scott (+52%).Now, eBay follows in the path of streetwear resale channel GOAT Group, which acquired competitor Grailed in 2022. What began as a diverse landscape of resale platforms emerging from the 2000s to the 2010s is slowly evolving into a landscape ruled by megaplatforms. Indeed, Depop may very well benefit from the technological and financial infrastructure of eBay, but the shift prompts questions about how resale could change with fewer and fewer independent channels.Among all of the fashion-focussed resale channels, Depop has emerged as one of the most attractive to Gen Z. As of the end of December, it had accumulated 7 million active buyers, 90% under the age of 34. Depop covers a wide base of brands, price points, and consumer demographics. With less spending power than their Millennial and Gen X counterparts, more accessible prices on Depop are an incentive for young shoppers. eBay’s CEO emphasised that the acquisition would enable the company “to reach a younger demographic across the expanding recommerce landscape.”The platform’s 2026 trend report also signals a changing tone in resale. Among the closing remarks was, “Consumers are choosing quality over quantity, emotional connection over novelty and personal authorship over algorithm-driven churn.” Depop’s report showed a shift toward “dependable silhouettes and repeatable staples,” “blending fragments of the 70s, 90s and early 2000s,” and an “appetite for reworked and elevated sports staples.”At the same time, casual brands are trying to take resale in-house. GapVintage launched in early 2025, tapping Round Two founder and designer Sean Wotherspoon as its curator. Just this week, Japanese retailer BEAMS opened its \"Digroo\" platform for, beginning with a 1000-piece drop curated by BEAMS employees. What these two initiatives share in common is the focus on expert and in-house curation. Unlike Depop and eBay, where customers often buy from strangers, DTC resale enjoys the benefit of stronger trust in quality control and curatorial appeal from brands. However, if mega resale platforms continue to gain ground, one can imagine that some brands may scale back with their independent efforts and outsource resale operations to a company like eBay.The signs tell us that resale could continue to consolidate, or we may see in-house resale take off as more companies establish their own channels.The online apparel resale market stands at a pivotal point with two key directions. The signs tell us that resale could continue to consolidate, or we may see in-house resale take off as more companies establish their own channels. Currently, both seem like viable possibilities and could even coexist.It shouldn’t be forgotten that resale is far older than the Internet, and its benefits go far beyond nostalgia and affordability. There's a magic in the experience of classic in-person thrifting from mom-and-pops and stores like Goodwill, which are very much alive and well. There’s something irreplaceable about taking the time to file through each hanger with no algorithm to guide you, allowing you not only to see and touch an unedited selection, but to feel the excitement of discovering something new.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "Summary Hypeart and Bonhams are partnering to present the \"Under the Same Sky\" exhibition at Frieze LA 2026 The curated collection highlights Postwar West Coast art that blends internal emotions with the outside worldAs the global art world gathers on the West Coast for Frieze Los Angeles next week, Hypeart is proud to announce the next chapter of our ongoing curatorial partnership with Bonhams. Co-curated by Hypeart’s Erin Ikeuchi and Keith Estiler, a special presentation titled Under the Same Sky will be featured within Bonhams' Made in California and Beyond exhibition and auction.The curation explores the rich legacy and energy of Postwar West Coast art. It captures a unique era when artists were responding to shifting social realities and experimenting with unconventional materials. Rather than separating their internal emotions from the changing world around them, these creators allowed the two spaces to overlap. Hypeart's Under the Same Sky sets up a compelling dialogue across two distinct moods. The first half of the collection focuses on internal states as places of personal reflection and play. Visitors can expect to see energetic boxing sketches by Ernie Barnes, the sculptural mastery of Isamu Noguchi and clever visual games from Ed Moses. In contrast, the second half of the presentation opens up with a more explosive and expansive energy. Works by contemporary heavyweights like Joe Goode, Julian Schnabel and Roy De Forest emphasize rugged materiality and physical movement. For those in town, the Made in California and Beyond preview will be open to the public in Los Angeles from February 24 to March 1, 2026. Stay tuned for more details.

        "title": "Anish Kapoor Presents New 'Mirror Works' in NYC",
        "text": "Summary ‘Mirror Works’ spotlights Anish Kapoor’s reflective stainless-steel sculptures that distort space and perception The New York show arrives amid a major run of international museum exhibitionsA focused presentation of mirror sculptures by Anish Kapoor has opened in New York's Lisson Gallery under the title 'Mirror Works', bringing together pieces created between 2010 and the present. The exhibition continues the artist’s decades-long exploration of scale, color, volume and material, foregrounding stainless-steel forms that shift and destabilize the viewer’s sense of space.Known for transforming perception into a physical experience, Kapoor approaches sculpture not as a static object but as a spatial event. His reflective surfaces bend architecture, swallow light and return distorted images of the viewer, turning the gallery into an immersive environment that changes with every movement.Among the works on view is \"Non Object (Plane)\" (2010), a folded sheet of highly polished stainless steel that leans against the wall with an almost improbable lightness. Its mirrored surface refracts the surrounding space, blurring the boundary between object and illusion. In \"Double Vertigo\" (2012), paired concave forms create a compounded optical pull, subtly disorienting viewers as reflections collapse inward.A more recent work, \"Untitled\" (2023), presents a large stainless-steel cuboid organized around a central void. Rather than absorbing light, the interior reflects it, transforming emptiness into an active visual field. Meanwhile, \"Stave (Red)\" (2015) introduces a lacquered red surface, a color long associated with interiority in Kapoor’s practice, heightening both emotional charge and spatial tension.The exhibition follows Kapoor’s recent presentation at the Jewish Museum in New York and coincides with his first U.S. institutional exhibition dedicated exclusively to painting at the SCAD Museum of Art, opening February 9, 2026.

        "text": "Summary TIMM’s Inverted House in Tbilisi flips traditional hierarchy, placing living areas above and private spaces below to capture city viewsThe 1,010-square-meter concrete structure features a central atrium and internal courtyards to integrate natural lightLocated in the historic and eclectic context of Tbilisi, Georgia, the Inverted House is a distinctive residential project designed by the architecture studio TIMM. The project takes its name from its radical organizational logic, which flips the traditional hierarchy of a home to respond to the site’s steep topography and dense urban surroundings. By placing the primary living areas on the upper levels and the more private, cellular spaces below, the architects have managed to capture expansive views of the city’s skyline while maintaining a sense of seclusion and retreat from the street level.The 1,010 square-meter, single‑family home is composed of layered volumes that invert the conventional relationship between house and fence. By turning the dwelling into its own perimeter, TIMM creates a central courtyard and inward‑focused spaces that encourage intimacy while still offering expansive views. The design emphasizes rhythm and repetition, with carefully offset geometries that generate both privacy and openness. This inversion logic allows the house to breathe, integrating natural light and ventilation into its core.Inside, the home is organized around a light-filled vertical atrium that serves as the \"circulatory heart\" of the building. This void allows natural light to penetrate deep into the lower levels, which are carved into the hillside, ensuring that even the most subterranean rooms feel airy and connected to the outdoors. The material palette is intentionally restrained, featuring exposed concrete, natural wood and black steel accents. This raw, industrial aesthetic is softened by the play of natural light and the inclusion of internal courtyards, which provide private pockets of greenery within the rigid geometric frame.Beyond its striking form, the Inverted House is an exploration of how contemporary architecture can engage with the complex terrain of Tbilisi. The design utilizes the slope of the land to create tiered terraces and rooftop gardens, effectively doubling the usable outdoor space. By merging structural innovation with a deep sensitivity to light and shadow, TIMM has created a residence that is both a modern landmark and a quiet sanctuary.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "title": "Trump warns he’s considering limited strikes as Iranian diplomat says proposed deal is imminent",
        "text": "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, speaks during a bilateral meeting between Switzerland and Iran, in Geneva, Switzerland, Tuesday, Feb. 17, 2026 (Cyril Zingaro/Keystone via AP)2026-02-20T17:31:09Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump warned on Friday that limited strikes against Iran are possible even as the country’s top diplomat said Tehran expects to have a proposed deal ready in the next few days following nuclear talks with the United States.In response to a reporter’s question on whether the U.S. could take limited military action as the countries negotiate, Trump said, “I guess I can say I am considering that.” Earlier, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a TV interview that his country was planning to finalize a draft deal in “the next two to three days” to then send to Washington.“I don’t think it takes long, perhaps, in a matter of a week or so, we can start real, serious negotiations on the text and come to a conclusion,” Araghchi said on MSNOW’s “Morning Joe” show. The tensions between the longtime adversaries have ramped up as the Trump administration pushes for concessions from Iran and has built up the largest U.S. military presence in the Middle East in decades, with more warships and aircraft on the way. Both countries have signaled that they are prepared for war if talks on Tehran’s nuclear program fizzle out.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“We are prepared for war, and we are prepared for peace,” Araghchi said Friday. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nTrump said a day earlier that he believes 10 to 15 days is “enough time” for Iran to reach a deal following recent rounds of indirect negotiations, including this week in Geneva, that made little visible progress. But the talks have been deadlocked for years, and Iran has refused to discuss wider U.S. and Israeli demands that it scale back its missile program and sever ties to armed groups.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nAraghchi also said Friday that his American counterparts have not asked for zero enrichment of uranium as part of the latest round of talks, which is in contradiction to what U.S. officials have said.“What we are now talking about is how to make sure that Iran’s nuclear program, including enrichment, is peaceful and will remain peaceful forever,” he said. \n    \n        \n    \n\nHe added that in return Iran will implement some confidence-building measures in exchange for relief on economic sanctions. In response to Araghchi’s claim, a White House official said Trump has been clear that Iran cannot have nuclear weapons or the capacity to build them and that it cannot enrich uranium. The official wasn’t authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Tehran has long insisted that any negotiations should only focus on its nuclear program and that it hasn’t been enriching uranium since U.S. and Israeli strikes last June on Iranian nuclear sites. Trump said at the time that the strikes had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear sites, but the exact damage is unknown as Tehran has barred international inspectors.Iran has also insisted that its nuclear program is peaceful. The U.S. and others suspect it is aimed at eventually developing weapons.___Amiri reported from New York. Associated Press writers Michelle L.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)2026-02-20T14:32:50Z\n                                        MILAN (AP) — Nathan MacKinnon scored the go-ahead goal with 35.2 seconds left after Shea Theodore tied it midway through the third period and Canada survived another scare at the Olympics, rallying to beat Finland 3-2 in the semifinals on Friday night and advance to the men’s gold-medal game.Theodore’s shot through traffic beating Juuse Saros with 9:26 left in regulation brought the bench and a crowd full of red and white back to life after going quiet when Mikko Rantanen scored first for Finland, which then went up by two on Erik Haula’s shorthanded goal. MacKinnon’s power play goal set off a celebration as the team from the birthplace of the sport will look to win its third consecutive title at the Games when NHL players participate.The Canadians had tilted the ice toward Saros since Haula scored. They outshot Finland 14-3 in the second period when Sam Reinhart got them on the board with a tip of Cale Makar’s shot, and Theodore scored on their ninth shot of the third, seconds after Brad Marchand was on top of Saros following a shove from Haula.\n    \n        \n    \n\nConnor McDavid, wearing the “C” in the absence of injured captain Sidney Crosby, made a perfect saucer pass over Finland penalty killer Roope Hintz’s stick to MacKinnon for another memorable goal for Canada in Milan.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nIt held up on video review after Finland challenged that the play was offside.Moments before MacKinnon scored, Saros made a nifty blocker save to deny the Colorado Avalanche star, who was high-sticked by Niko Mikkola to put Canada on the power play. Saros also made several more big stops before MacKinnon tucked the puck in short side with Macklin Celebrini setting a screen by jumping.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nCanada’s stacked lineup, even missing Crosby, eventually broke through the Finnish trap that slows players down and intercepts the puck before an opponent can go deep into the offensive zone. Instead of getting frustrated, some of the best players on the roster led the way, with Celebrini shooting just about every chance he had.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe comeback kept alive the possibility of an all-North America gold-medal game a year after Canada and the U.S. met in the final of the 4 Nations Face-Off following their epic matchup earlier in that NHL and NHLPA-run tournament.The U.S. still has to hold up its end of the bargain to make that happen. The unbeaten Americans face Slovakia in the second semifinal on Friday night.___AP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                STEPHEN WHYNO\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Whyno has covered the NHL, international hockey, NFL and horse racing for The Associated Press since 2016.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        facebook",

        "text": "Eric Dane and Rebecca Gayheart arrive at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards at the Shrine Auditorium, Sept. 16, 2007, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Kevork Djansezian, File)2026-02-20T16:42:19Z\n                                        Eric Dane, known for his roles on “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Euphoria,” died this week from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis at age 53.The fatal nervous system disease, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, killed Dane less than a year after he announced his diagnosis.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ALS is rare. In 2022, there were nearly 33,000 estimated cases, say researchers, who project that cases will rise to more than 36,000 by 2030. The disease is slightly more common in men than in women and tends to strike in midlife, between the ages of 40 and 60.Here’s what to know.\n    \n        \n    \n\nWhat is ALS?It affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, causing loss of muscle control and getting worse over time. ALS causes nerve cells in the upper and lower parts of the body to stop working and die. Nerves no longer trigger specific muscles, eventually leading to paralysis. People with ALS may develop problems with mobility, speaking, swallowing and breathing.The exact cause of the disease is unknown, and Mayo Clinic experts said a small number of cases are inherited.It’s called Lou Gehrig’s disease after the Hall of Fame New York Yankees player. Gehrig was diagnosed with ALS in 1939 on his 36th birthday, died in 1941 and was the face of ALS for decades.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nWhat are some signs of ALS?Experts say the first symptoms are often subtle. The disease may begin with muscle twitching and weakness in an arm or leg.Over time, muscles stop acting and reacting correctly, said experts at University of California San Francisco Health. People may lose strength and coordination in their arms and legs; feet and ankles may become weak; and muscles in the arms, shoulders and tongue may cramp or twitch. Swallowing and speaking may become difficult and fatigue may set in.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe ability to think, see, hear, smell, taste and touch are usually not affected, UCSF experts said.Eventually, muscles used for breathing may become paralyzed. Patients may be unable to swallow and inhale food or saliva. Most people with ALS die of respiratory failure.\n    \n        \n    \n\nHow is ALS diagnosed and treated?The disease is difficult to diagnose because there’s no test or procedure to confirm it. Generally, doctors will perform a physical exam, lab tests and imaging of the brain and spinal cord.A doctor may interpret certain things as signs of ALS, including an unusual flexing of the toes, diminished fine motor coordination, painful muscle cramps, twitching and spasticity, a type of stiffness causing jerky movements.There’s no known cure for ALS, but the drug riluzole has been approved for treatment. According to the Mayo Clinic, it may extend survival in the early stages of the disease or extend the time until a breathing tube is needed. Another much-debated drug, Relyvrio, was pulled from the U.S. market by Amylyx Pharmaceuticals in 2024. Its development had been financed, in part, by the ALS Association, the major beneficiary of the 2014 “ ice bucket challenge ” viral phenomenon. Other medications are sometimes prescribed to help control symptoms.Choking is common as ALS progresses, so patients may need feeding tubes. People may also use braces, wheelchairs, speech synthesizers or computer-based communication systems.\n    \n        \n    \n\nAfter the onset of the disease, experts say patients may survive from two years to a decade. Most people live from two to five years after symptoms develop, and about a fifth live more than five years after they are diagnosed.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

        "text": "IEEE has enhanced its standing as a trusted, neutral authority on the role of technology in climate change mitigation and adaption. Last year it became the first technical association to be invited to a U.N. Conference of the Parties on Climate Change.IEEE representatives participated in several sessions at COP30, held from 11 to 20 November in Belém, Brazil. More than 56,000 delegates attended, including policymakers, technologists, and representatives from industry, finance, and development agencies.Following the conference, IEEE helped host the selective International Symposium on Achieving a Sustainable Climate. The International Telecommunication Union and IEEE hosted ISASC on 16 and 17 December at ITU’s headquarters in Geneva. Among the more than 100 people who attended were U.N. agency representatives, diplomats, senior leaders from academia, and experts from government, industry, nongovernment organizations, and standards development bodies.Power and energy expert Saifur Rahman, the 2023 IEEE president, led IEEE’s delegation at both events. Rahman is the immediate past chair of IEEE’s Technology for a Sustainable Climate Matrix Organization, which coordinates, communicates, and amplifies the organization’s efforts.IEEE’s evolving role at COPIEEE first attended a COP in 2021.“Over successive COPs, IEEE’s role has evolved from contributing individual technical sessions to being recognized as a trusted partner in climate action,” Rahman noted in a summary of COP30. “There is [a] growing demand for engineering insight, not just to discuss technologies but [also] to help design pathways for deployment, capacity-building, and long-term resilience.”Joining Rahman at COP30 were IEEE Fellow Claudio Canizares and IEEE Member Filipe Emídio Tôrres.Canizares is a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Waterloo, in Ontario, Canada, and the executive director of the university’s sustainable energy institute.Tôrres chairs the IEEE Centro-Norte Brasil Section (Brazil Chapter). An entrepreneur and a former professor, he is pursuing a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering at the University of Brasilia. He also represented the IEEE Young Professionals group while attending the conference.In the Engineering for Climate Resilience: Water Planning, Energy Transition, Biodiversity session, Rahman showed a video from his 2024 visit to Shennongjia, China, where he monitored a clean energy project designed to protect endangered snub-nosed monkeys from human encroachment. The project integrates renewable energy, which helps preserve the forest and its wildlife.Rahman also chaired a session at the Sustainable Development Goal Pavilion on balancing decarbonization efforts between industrialized and emerging economies.Additionally, he participated in a joint panel discussion hosted by IEEE and the World Federation of Engineering Organizations on engineering strategies for climate resilience, including energy transition and biodiversity.Rahman, Canizares, and Tôrres took part in a session on clean-tech solutions for a sustainable climate, hosted by the International Youth Nuclear Congress. The topics included fossil fuel–free electricity for communications in remote areas and affordable electricity solutions for off-grid areas.The three also joined several panels organized by the IYNC that addressed climate resilience, career pathways in sustainability, and a mentoring program.“Over successive COPs, IEEE’s role has evolved from contributing individual technical sessions to being recognized as a trusted partner in climate action.” —Saifur Rahman, 2023 IEEE president The IYNC hosted the Voices of Transition: Including Pathways to a Clean Energy Future session, for which Tôrres and Rahman were panelists. They discussed the need to include underrepresented and marginalized groups, which often get overlooked in projects that convert communities to renewable energy.Rahman, Canizares, and Tôrres visited the COP Village, where they met several of the 5,000 Indigenous leaders participating in the conference and discussed potential partnerships and collaborations. Climate change has made the land where the Indigenous people live more susceptible to severe droughts and wildfires, particularly in the Amazon region.Rahman and Tôrres took a field trip to the Federal University of Para, where they met several faculty members and students and toured the LASSE engineering lab.A meaningful experienceTôrres, who says representing IEEE at COP30 was transformative, wrote a detailed report about the event.“The experience reaffirmed my belief that engineering and technology, when combined with respect for cultural diversity, can play a critical role in shaping a more sustainable and equitable world,” he wrote. “It highlighted the importance of combining cutting-edge technological solutions with Indigenous wisdom and cultural knowledge to address the climate crisis.”COP30 webinar Rahman and Canizares give an overview of their COP30 experiences in an IEEE webinar.“IEEE has a place at the table,” Rahman says in the video. “We want to showcase outside our comfort zone what IEEE can do. We go to all these global events so that our name becomes a familiar term. We are the first technical association organization ever to go to COP and talk about engineering.”Canizares added that IEEE is now collaborating closely with the United Nations.“This is an important interaction. And I think, moving forward, IEEE will become more relevant, particularly in the context of technology deployment,” he said. “As governments start technology deployments, they will see IEEE as a provider of solutions.”ISASC takeawaysRahman was the general chair of the ISASC event, which focused on the delivery and deployment of clean energy. Among the presenters were IEEE members including Canizares, Paulina Chan, Surekha Deshmukh, Ashutosh Dutta, Tariq Durrani, Samina Husain, Bruce Kraemer, Bruno Meyer, Carlo Alberto Nucci, and Seizo Onoe.Sessions were organized around six themes: energy transition, information and communication technology, financing, case studies, technical standards, and public-private collaborations. A detailed report includes the discussions, insights, and opportunities identified throughout ISASC.Here are some key takeaways.Although the technology exists to transition to renewable energy, most power grid systems are not ready. Deployment is increasingly constrained by transmission bottlenecks, interconnection delays, permitting challenges, and system flexibility. There’s also a skills shortage.Energy transition pathways must be region-specific and should consider local resources, social conditions, funding opportunities, and development priorities.Information and communication technologies are central to climate mitigation solutions, despite growing concerns about their environmental impact. Even though the technologies are used in beneficial ways, such as early-warning systems for natural disasters and smart water management, they also are driving the rapid growth of data centers for artificial intelligence applications—which has increased energy prices and driven up water demand.Technical standards are a means of accelerating adoption, interoperability, and trust in green technology. There needs to be greater coordination among standards development organizations, particularly at the convergence of energy systems, information technologies, and AI. Fragmented standards hinder interoperability. The lack of technical standards is a major constraint on project financing, limiting investors’ confidence and slowing technology deployment.Training and outreach efforts are important for successfully implementing standards, especially in developing regions. IEEE’s global membership and regional sections can be critical channels to address the needs.A technology assessment toolAs part of ISASC, IEEE presented a technology assessment tool prototype. The web-based platform is designed to help policymakers, practitioners, and investors compare technology options against climate goals.The tool can run a comparative analysis of sustainable climate technologies and integrate publicly available, expert-validated data.IEEE can help the world meet its goalsThe ISASC report concluded that by connecting engineering expertise with real-world deployment challenges, IEEE is working to translate global climate goals into measurable actions.The discussions highlighted that the path forward lies less in inventing new technologies and more in aligning systems to deliver ones that already exist.Summaries of COP30 and ISASC are available on the IEEE Technology for a Sustainable Climate website.",

We also post a weekly calendar of upcoming robotics events for the next few months. Please send us your events for inclusion.ICRA 2026: 1–5 June 2026, VIENNAEnjoy today’s videos! So, humanoid robots are nearing peak human performance. I would point out, though, that this is likely very far from peak robot performance, which has yet to be effectively exploited, because it requires more than just copying humans.[ Unitree ]“The Street Dance of China” Turning lightness into gravity, and rhythm into impact.This is a head-on collision between metal and beats. This Chinese New Year, watch PNDbotics Adam bring the heat with a difference.[ PNDbotics ]You had me at robot pandas.[ MagicLab ]NASA’s Perseverance rover can now precisely determine its own location on Mars without waiting for human help from Earth. This is possible thanks to a new technology called Mars Global Localization. This technology rapidly compares panoramic images from the rover’s navigation cameras with onboard orbital terrain maps. It’s done with an algorithm that runs on the rover’s Helicopter Base Station processor, which was originally used to communicate with the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter. In a few minutes, the algorithm can pinpoint Perseverance’s position to within about 10 inches (25 centimeters). The technology will help the rover drive farther autonomously and keep exploring. [ NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory ]Legs? Where we’re going, we don’t need legs![ Paper ]This is a bit of a tangent to robotics, but it gets a pass because of the cute jumping spider footage.[ Berkeley Lab ]Corvus One for Cold Chain is engineered to live and operate in freezer environments permanently, down to -20°F, while maintaining full flight and barcode scanning performance.I am sure there is an excellent reason for putting a cold storage facility in the Mojave desert.[ Corvus Robotics ]The video documents the current progress made in the picking rate of the Shiva robot when picking strawberries. It first shows the previous status, then the further development, and finally the field test.[ DFKI ]Data powers an organization’s digital transformation, and ST Engineering MRAS is leveraging Spot to get a full view of critical equipment and facility. Working autonomously, Spot collects information about machine health - and now, thanks to an integration of the Leica BLK ARC for reality capture, detailed and accurate point cloud data for their digital twin.[ Boston Dynamics ]The title of this video is “Get out and have fun!” Is that mostly what humanoid robots are good for right now, pretty much...?[ Engine AI ]ASTORINO is a modern 6-axis robot based on 3D printing technology. Programmable in AS-language, it facilitates the preparation of classes with ready-made teaching materials, is easy both to use and to repair, and gives the opportunity to learn and make mistakes without fear of breaking it.[ Kawasaki ]Can I get this in my living room?[ Yaskawa ]What does it mean to build a humanoid robot in seven months, and the next one in just five? This documentary takes you behind the scenes at Humanoid, a UK-based AI and robotics company building reliable, safe, and  helpful humanoid robots. You’ll hear directly from our engineering, hardware, product, and other teams as they share their perspectives on the journey of turning physical AI into reality.[ Humanoid ]This IROS 2025 keynote is from Tim Chung who is now at Microsoft, on “Catalyzing the Future of Human, Robot, and AI Agent Teams in the Physical World.”The convergence of technologies—from foundation AI models to diverse sensors and actuators to ubiquitous connectivity—is transforming the nature of interactions in the physical and digital world. People have accelerated their collaborative connections and productivity through digital and immersive technologies, no longer limited by geography or language or access. Humans have also leveraged and interacted with AI in many different forms, with the advent of hyperscale AI models (i.e., large language models) forever changing (and at an ever-astonishing pace) the nature of human-AI teams, realized in this era of the AI “copilot.” Similarly, robotics and automation technologies now afford greater opportunities to work with and/or near humans, allowing for increasingly collaborative physical robots to dramatically impact real-world activities. It is the compounding effect of enabling all three capabilities, each complementary to one another in valuable ways, and we envision the triad formed by human-robot-AI teams as revolutionizing the future of society, the economy, and of technology.[ IROS 2025 ]This GRASP SFI talk is by Chris Paxton at Agility Robotics, on “How Close Are We To Generalist Humanoid Robots?”With billions of dollars of funding pouring into robotics, general-purpose humanoid robots seem closer than ever. And certainly it feels like the pace of robotics is faster than ever, with multiple companies beginning large-scale deployments of humanoid robots. In this talk, I’ll go over the challenges still facing scaling robot learning, looking at insights from a year of discussions with researchers all over the world.[ University of Pennsylvania GRASP Laboratory ]This week’s CMU RI Seminar is from Jitendra Malik at UC Berkeley, on “Robot Learning, With Inspiration From Child Development.”For intelligent robots to become ubiquitous, we need to “solve” locomotion, navigation and manipulation at sufficient reliability in widely varying environments. In locomotion, we now have demonstrations of humanoid walking in a variety of challenging environments. In navigation, we pursued the task of “Go to Any Thing” – a robot, on entering  a newly rented Airbnb, should be able to find objects such as TV sets or potted plants. RL in simulation and sim-to-real have been workhorse technologies for us, assisted by a few technical innovations. I will sketch promising directions for future work.[ Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute ]",

Following up on the mohair versions of the NEEDLES tracksuit unveiled in December 2025, this week, the partners are teasing another variant featuring horizontal stripes.The updated look echoes BEAMS and NEEDLES' 2023 collaboration, which utilized similar silhouettes offered in NEEDLES' classic purple colorways. However, the 2026 edition arrives in an all-new palette: rich brown with electric blue details, including the iconic NEEDLES butterfly on the breast and leg. Additionally, they removed the zipper from the top, updating it with an athletic collar akin to what one might find on a soccer jersey—a timely detail as the 2026 World Cup approaches.BEAMS has been carrying NEEDLES' clothes in its retail locations for more than 25 years, but their first collaboration came in 2017. The very first collaboration included a pair of printed Vans and a skateboarding-inspired tracksuit; however, the partners have continued to interpolate on each other's classic styles over the last ten years.The SS26 BEAMS x NEEDLES set is expected to drop at the brand's Japanese locations and webstores on February 21, 2026.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "As New York Fashion Week descends upon the city, Who Decides War teams up with Intuit TurboTax to explore the intersection of business and art. The partnership, which spotlights how New York creatives blend entrepreneurial spirit with creativity, debuts a four-piece capsule that interprets street style through the lens of corporate America.Based on Who Decides War’s penchant for deconstructed denim, the custom collection delivers all-around lifestyle pieces, including a structured racer jacket (crafted from a water-resistant vinyl fabric), a distressed trucker button-up and a cotton hoodie. A tote bag with graphic elements tops off the capsule, nodding to the citydweller’s favorite low-key accessory. From a design standpoint, Ev Bravado and Téla D'Amore bring their unique design DNA to the range, anchoring to TurboTax’s pepper and watermelon color palette through intricate topstitching and silver-toned hardware to unify both brands. The capsule's thematic motifs and stylized typography pay homage to TurboTax's grand arrival in SoHo, New York, colloquially recognized as Manhattan's Cast Iron Historic District.  [-]The hero product is a monochromatic, race-inspired zip-up with a scoop collar. Watermelon flames envelop the sleeves and cuff, with “463 Broadway” lettering decorating the front panel. The statement design welcomes TurboTax’s SoHo flagship store, which is making modern tax filing easy and accessible to the surrounding NY community. This two-tone scheme carries over on the peppered denim button-up jacket, which shows designer D’Amore’s signature embroidery at the sleeves — the brand’s iconic motif symbolizing perseverance and resilience.Contrast topstitching along the collar, front panels, sleeves, and hem creates a weathered look that highlights the jacket’s structured frame. In conversation with Hypebeast, D'amore explained the garments are meant to be worn-in — practical clothing pieces that demonstrate the city's work ethic and approach to fashion that wears its hustle on the sleeve. Referencing its initial pattern drafts, the accompanying hoodie features a similar abstract construction, with asymmetrical panels comprising the body. This textured feel is enhanced with delicate embroidery at the chest. Across the board, the capsule's deconstructed elements highlight Who Decides War's studio home base in New York City’s garment district, a historical hub for design and fabrication — highlighting the local vendors, suppliers and creatives that power the city. A black tote bag completes the collection. Graphic screenprints of the label’s respected logo dress the front panel, with a co-branded TurboTax logo appended to the interior, to marry the capsule’s ethos in a singular design. Equally striking when styled as standalone pieces, these workwear silhouettes spotlight Who Decides War’s ability to tell cultural narratives one piece at a time.Each garment is finished with a custom dedication to the cross streets of Broadway and Grand in NYC, where the clothing first debuted at TurboTax’s new state-of-the-art flagship store. The dedication is a nod to local creators, business owners and the broader community looking to empower their next financial move with confidence, with the support of a local TurboTax expert, who can meet in-person, answer questions, and can help file your taxes for you entirely, so you can keep focused on your next endeavor.Browse the full collection in the galleries above, and head to Who Decides War’s website to see more from the brand.Read more at Hypebeast",

        "text": "Brendon Babenzien exits J.Crew, while debut campaigns from Pierpaolo Piccioli (Balenciaga) and McCollough &amp; Hernandez (Loewe) signal new aesthetic eras.Jack Carlson leans into \"Ivy\" history at J.Press, and Bode opens a nostalgic flagship store in Tokyo.eBay acquires Depop for $1.2B to dominate the Gen Z secondhand market.Brendon Babenzien to Exit J.Crew as Men's Creative DirectorAfter a transformative four-year tenure, Brendon Babenzien is stepping down as the Men’s Creative Director of J.Crew. Since joining in 2021, the Noah co-founder has been credited with a successful \"neo-prep\" turnaround, reviving the brand’s 1990s archival aesthetic and reintroducing the iconic physical catalog. Under his direction, the label moved away from slim-fit trends toward relaxed silhouettes like the \"Giant Fit\" chino. While J.Crew has yet to name a successor, Babenzien will now shift his full focus back to his independent label, Noah.What Depop's $1B USD eBay Merge Means for ResaleThe resale landscape is shifting toward \"megaplatforms\" following eBay’s $1.2 billion USD acquisition of Depop. This major deal underscores the explosive growth of the secondhand market, which is projected to reach $367 billion by 2029. By acquiring the Gen Z-favorite app, eBay taps into Depop's younger demographic that prioritizes quality and \"repeatable staples\" over fast-fashion cycles. As consolidation continues, the move raises questions about whether more brands will eventually outsource their in-house resale operations to these tech giants.Jack Carlson Is J. Press's In-House Ivy ArchaeologistJack Carlson brought a scholarly touch to New York Fashion Week with his sophomore collection for J. Press. Staged at the New York Historical Society, the SS26 range serves as a tribute to the 1965 cult-classic book Take Ivy. Carlson, who holds a PhD in archaeology, approaches the heritage brand as a \"steward\" of authentic American Ivy style rather than chasing mass-market trends. The collection emphasizes traditional craftsmanship, featuring three-button sport coats and Shaggy Dog sweaters that honor the brand's 123-year history.Pierpaolo Piccioli Unveils First Balenciaga Campaign \"Heart and Body\"Marking a new era for Balenciaga, Creative Director Pierpaolo Piccioli has released his debut campaign, \"Heart and Body.\" Lensed by David Sims in a Parisian artist's atelier, the campaign features a star-studded cast including Winona Ryder, Harris Dickinson, and Hudson Williams. Moving away from eccentric personas, Piccioli’s vision focuses on \"individuals, not characters,\" emphasizing humanity and self-confidence. The imagery showcases a blend of modern silhouettes and classic techniques, defining a more intimate visual language for the storied House.Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez Unveil Their First Loewe Campaign for Spring/Summer 2026Creative duo Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez have officially signaled their arrival at LOEWE with their first full SS26 campaign. Shot by Talia Chetrit, the sun-drenched visuals trade traditional luxury tropes for a \"carnal tension\" defined by wet textures and sculptural forms. Tapping a cast of rising actors like Talia Ryder and Isla Johnston, the campaign highlights the brand's 180th anniversary with the new Amazona 180 bag. The collection, which features shredded leather and fluid dresses, lands in boutiques on February 26.Bode Opens First Tokyo Flagship in Yoyogi-UeharaEmily Adams Bode Aujla has expanded her craft-focused universe to Japan with the opening of Bode’s first Tokyo flagship. Located in the quiet, artisanal neighborhood of Yoyogi-Uehara, the store avoids traditional commercial hubs in favor of a lived-in, domestic atmosphere. Designed alongside Green River Project, the interior features warm woodwork and Shaker-inspired details that complement the brand’s signature upcycled textiles. The space serves as a permanent community hub for a Japanese market that has long championed Bode's unique historical storytelling.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "SummaryChoker returns after seven years with the 11-track LP Heaven Ain't Sold, a deeply personal project reflecting his growth and regained self-trust.The album features his signature genre-blending sound, moving from soulful acapella and piano ballads to trap-influenced production and ambient synths.Following a 7-year break after releasing his EP Forever &amp; A Few, Choker returns with his highly anticipated LP Heaven Ain't Sold. The elusive singer-songwriter has reemerged with an 11-track EP including singles \"Uneven,\" \"Proof,\" and the project's titular track.In an Instagram post, just days away from the release, Choker shared, \"Somehow this album carries every version of me that’s came and went since the last time I shared a project; it’s the lump sum of what I gleaned from uncertainty, the flickers of conviction I tamed and rode til I was bucked off and had to search again, my mistakes, my triumphs, whether it’s spelled out or not it’s all in there. \"\"I regained trust in myself through the process, learned how to give myself the grace I used to only afford to others. It’s surreal knowing that come Friday, y'all will hear what I found,\" he continued. View this post on InstagramA post shared by choker (@choker) Indeed, Choker's sonic signatures are written all over his latest album, blending a bedroom pop feel with RnB vocals and warm acoustic instrumentation. The opening track Geppetto is a fitting exposition, opening with the repeating lyric \"Can we start again?\", \"I'll be different.\" The artist fills the ear with velvety acapella at the outro, singing \"I don't wanna be a Phantom.Later, \"Universoul Circus\" and \"Good\" stand out with trap-influenced productions and rapped verses, while \"Uneven\" and \"Radio Freestyle\" are soft-spoken piano ballads. Finally, \"Angel Station\" closes the LP, droning with ambient synths and swelling vocals.Listen to the new LP from Choker Heaven Ain't Sold, now.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

The main entrance served a feature wall dressed in basketballs, the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy as well as two rims with nets covered in crystals that made for the perfect photo op moment. The vast space was filled with a range of archival memorabilia, including signed jerseys and framed pictures of basketball icons past and present, for guests to get up close and explore the history of NBA All-Star.While Mo Mooncey came with the MC energy, DJ Jadon provided the soundtrack for the night with a mix of hits as attendees seamlessly wandered between the watch room and the bar area to grab a curated menu of cocktails and an elevated spin on classic chicken and waffles.London-based artist Tegan Price drew guests into her dedicated space as she hosted customization workshop sessions throughout the evening. Turning her signature illustrations into heat-applied patches, stickers and wet-transferred art, people were invited to decorate basketballs their own way.To capture the vibe of the event, we enlisted Sosa to catch London’s energy through his lens — getting the crowd’s reactions and asking the questions people wanted to know.

        "text": "Cytomegalovirus is a form of herpesvirus that is prevalent in the human population. As is the case for other herpesviruses, the immune system struggles to clear cytomegalovirus from the body. It becomes a persistent infection. Few people make it to late life without being infected, at least judging by those regions of the world where there is good data on cytomegalovirus prevalence. Cytomegalovirus infection typically goes unnoticed and produces no evident symptoms, at least in the vast majority of individuals who have a normally functioning immune system. But evidence suggests that the presence of cytomegalovirus infection has a corrosive effect on the immune system in late life. Ever more cells become specialized to focus on cytomegalovirus at the expense of populations needed to conduct other [&#8230;]",

The consensus continues to be that amyloid aggregation is the originating cause of Alzheimer's disease, the pathology that sets the stage for what comes later. That hypothesis will be confirmed or disproven in the years ahead as anti-amyloid-β immunotherapies are deployed in ever earlier stages of the condition. There may be other approaches to obtaining useful data, however. Here, researchers note that an existing drug, levetiracetam, reduces amyloid-β production in the brain, which will in turn reduce misfolding and [&#8230;]",

One aspect of this pressure is that the standard, most widely used animal models of disease tend to be the ones that can be created as rapidly as possible, using various toxic, damaging strategies to reproduce aspects of aging in relatively young mice. Time has its own cost, and budgets don't stretch to waiting around for mice to get old. Thus in this modern era of enthusiasm for targeting the mechanisms of aging, the research community finds itself in the position of knowing too little about how aging interacts with disease processes. Mouse models of Parkinson's disease (PD) are invaluable for advancing [&#8230;]",
