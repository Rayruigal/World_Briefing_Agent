        "text": "The Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center, is seen Wednesday, Jan. 28, 2026, in Union City, Ga, near Atlanta, as FBI agents search at the main election facility. (AP Photo/Mike Stewart)2026-02-10T20:02:52Z\n                                        ATLANTA (AP) — The FBI obtained a search warrant to seize hundreds of boxes of ballots from election offices in Fulton County, Georgia, as part of a criminal investigation into possible “deficiencies or defects” in the vote count in the 2020 contest lost by President Donald Trump, according to an affidavit unsealed Tuesday.The affidavit provides the first public justification for an FBI search last month that targeted a county that Trump and allies have long seen as central to their false claim that the 2020 election was stolen.But the allegations outlined in the affidavit are largely based on claims that have long been made by people who assert that there was fraud in the 2020 election. Audits, state officials, courts and Trump’s own former attorney general have rejected the idea that there was widespread fraud in the 2020 election that could have altered the outcome.\n    \n        \n    \n\nAmong the “deficiencies or defects” investigators are looking at is Fulton County’s admission that it does not have scanned images of all the ballots counted during the original count or the recount, according to the affidavit. Fulton County has also confirmed that some ballots were scanned multiple times during the recount, the affidavit says.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n“If these deficiencies were the result of intentional action, it would be a violation of federal law regardless of whether the failure to retain records or the deprivation of a fair tabulation of a vote was outcome determinative for any particular election or race,” the document says.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe affidavit says seizures of the election records was necessary to determine whether election records were destroyed and or the tabulation of votes included materially false votes.” It cites potential violations of a law regarding the preservation and retention of election records, a misdemeanor. It also cites a law that makes it a crime to “knowingly and willfully” deprive residents of a “fair and impartially conducted election process,” which is a felony.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                KATE BRUMBACK\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Brumback covers courts, immigration, elections and breaking news.

        "text": "President Donald Trump steps off Air Force One, early Monday, Feb. 9, 2026, at Joint Base Andrews, Md., after returning from a trip to Florida. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)2026-02-10T16:37:37Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Governors Association will no longer hold a formal meeting with President Donald Trump when the group of state leaders meet in Washington later this month after the White House planned to invite only Republicans.“NGA staff was informed that the White House intends to limit invitations to the annual business meeting, scheduled for February 20, to Republican governors only,” Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican who is the chairman of the NGA, said in a Monday letter to fellow governors obtained by The Associated Press. “Because NGA’s mission is to represent all 55 governors, the Association is no longer serving as the facilitator for that event, and it is no longer included in our official program.”The NGA is scheduled to meet in Washington from Feb. 19-21. Representatives for Stitt, the White House and the NGA didn’t immediately comment on the letter.\n    \n        \n    \n\nBrandon Tatum, the NGA’s CEO, said in a statement last week that the White House meeting is an “important tradition” and said the organization was “disappointed in the administration’s decision to make it a partisan occasion this year.” \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe governors group is one of the few remaining venues where political leaders from both major parties gather to discuss the top issues facing their communities. In his letter, Stitt encouraged governors to unite around common goals.“We cannot allow one divisive action to achieve its goal of dividing us,” he wrote. “The solution is not to respond in kind, but to rise above and to remain focused on our shared duty to the people we serve. America’s governors have always been models of pragmatic leadership, and that example is most important when Washington grows distracted by politics.”\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nSigns of partisan tensions emerged at the White House meeting last year, when Trump and Maine’s then-Gov. Janet Mills traded barbs.\n    \n        \n    \n\nTrump singled out the Democratic governor over his push to bar transgender athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports, threatening to withhold federal funding from the state if she did not comply. Mills responded, “We’ll see you in court.”Trump then predicted that Mills’ political career would be over for opposing the order. She is now running for U.S. Senate.The back and forth had a lasting impact on last year’s conference and some Democratic governors did not renew their dues last year to the bipartisan group.___Peoples reported from New York. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JOEY CAPPELLETTI\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Cappelletti covers Congress for The Associated Press.

        "title": "Susan Collins announces reelection bid in pivotal Maine Senate race",
        "text": "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, departs the chamber at the Capitol in Washington, on July 24, 2025. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)2026-02-10T14:39:38Z\n                                        PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Republican Sen. Susan Collins announced her reelection bid Tuesday, betting that she can hold onto her coveted Maine seat despite a renewed Democratic effort to oust her in a race that could determine control of the U.S. Senate. The campaign will test Collins’ political survival skills. The 73-year-old has won five terms by casting herself as a reflection of Maine’s independent spirit, occasionally clashing with President Donald Trump while also largely supporting his agenda.“I have always worked across the aisle to solve problems. Maine needs experienced, steady leadership that focuses on getting things done,” Collins said in a Tuesday statement.As she seeks a sixth term, Collins faces outrage over immigration enforcement tactics that could become a political liability for Republican candidates across the country. A recent operation in Maine led to hundreds of arrests but also criticism that people were being rounded up even if they didn’t have criminal records. \n    \n        \n    \n\nCollins has taken credit for stopping the surge of federal agents in Maine after she spoke directly with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nHowever, Democrats accused Collins of not going far enough, pointing to her refusal to call for Noem’s ouster and her vote in favor of a bipartisan Homeland Security funding bill. The party needs to net four seats to retake the Senate majority, and they are aiming to do that in Maine, North Carolina, Alaska and Ohio.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nGov. Janet Mills and oyster farmer Graham Platner are among Collins’ top Democratic challengers. While many establishment Democrats and influential left-leaning groups have backed Mills, Platner has gained traction with his anti-establishment image and economic equality message. He’s campaigned aggressively while facing revelations of problematic social media posts and having to cover up a tattoo resembling a Nazi symbol.\n    \n        \n    \n\nMills has accused Collins of governing “without any courage” shortly after the Republican voted in favor of funding the DHS and several other agencies in January. She repeated that charge Tuesday.“Seniority without a backbone is just tenure, and after decades in Washington, Senator Collins has failed to demonstrate the leadership required in this dangerous moment in history,” she said in a statement.Platner has demanded that Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is part of DHS, be dismantled and said he did not believe Collins or the Trump administration’s promise to leave Maine. He said Tuesday in a post on the social platform X that Collins should have kept her promise to serve just two Senate terms.“That’s just one of a hundred reasons she doesn’t deserve a sixth term,” he wrote.Platner recently outraised both Mills and Collins, according to the latest federal filings. The first-time candidate collected nearly $4.6 million, while Mills raised $2.7 million. Collins, who had not yet officially launched her campaign during the filing period, had more than $8 million in cash on hand at the end of 2025.\n    \n        \n    \n\nCollins, who has said she didn’t vote for Trump in 2016, voted to convict the president after his 2021 impeachment over his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. After Collins joined a handful of Republican colleagues in backing a failed effort to limit the president’s ability to unilaterally use force in Venezuela, Trump said on social media that they “should never be elected to office again.”But Collins has also broadly backed Trump’s agenda, including his tax and spending bill, and his nominees. Notably, Collins voted to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Trump’s choice to be secretary of Health and Human Services. Kennedy has since espoused anti-vaccine policy and ousted public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.She has faced down tough challenges before. Democrat Sara Gideon raised $69 million in 2020, outspending Collins in a bid to help take back the Senate during a presidential election year when the Democrats won the top of the ticket. Collins defeated Gideon by more than 8 points. \n    \n        \n    \n\nCollins has remained in office despite Maine becoming increasingly blue. The proportion of registered Democrats has increased since her last reelection campaign, when “unenrolled” independent voters outnumbered Democrats in 2019 but now trail them in 2026. Republicans have trailed both groups for years.___Kruesi reported from Providence, Rhode Island.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                PATRICK WHITTLE\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Whittle is an Associated Press reporter based in Portland, Maine.

They’ve got to get back to the centre.I think it is fair if people want to remove the leader, then they should be prepared to put their hands up.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said more than 25 people are injured, including two with life-threatening injuries, after the shooting at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School.School shootings are rare in Canada.The town of Tumbler Ridge, which has a population of about 2,400 people, is more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) north of Vancouver, near the border with Alberta. “As part of the initial response to the active shooting, police entered the school to locate the threat. During the search, officers located multiple victims. An individual believed to be the shooter was also found deceased with what appears to be a self‑inflicted injury,” RCMP said in a statement. \n    \n        \n    \n\n“Six additional individuals, not including the suspect, have been located deceased inside the school. Two victims have been airlifted to hospital with serious or life‑threatening injuries. A third victim died while being transported to hospital.”\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe Peace River South School District said earlier Tuesday that there was a “lockdown and secure and hold” at both the secondary school and the Tumbler Ridge Elementary school.Larry Neufeld, the member of the legislature for Peace River South, told reporters at the legislature that an “excess” of resources, including RCMP and ambulance support, have been sent to the community.He said he didn’t want to release any more information over concerns that it might jeopardize the safety of the ongoing operation.The provincial government website lists Tumbler Ridge Secondary School as having 175 students from Grades 7 to 12.",

        "text": "Todd Lyons, acting director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) testifies during a House Committee on Homeland Security oversight hearing of the Department of Homeland Security: ICE CBP and USCIS, on Capitol Hill, Tuesday, Feb. 10, 2026, in Washington. (AP Photo/Tom Brenner)2026-02-10T23:07:17Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s top immigration officials appeared before Congress Tuesday for the first time since the shooting deaths of two American citizens in Minneapolis, seeking to defend their officers’ actions as their agencies face intensifying scrutiny over nationwide immigration enforcement operations. Todd Lyons, who is the acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, came in for some of the sharpest questioning during a more than 3-hour-long hearing in front of the House Homeland Security Committee. He appeared alongside Rodney Scott, who heads Customs and Border Protection, and Joseph Edlow, who leads U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.Lawmakers asked them about issues that have dominated the public discourse since Trump launched his mass deportations agenda at the start of his second term. Here are some of their answers. \n    \n        \n    \n\nDefending officers after 2 Americans were killed in MinneapolisLyons and Scott faced scrutiny over the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti but they repeatedly declined to answer questions, citing active investigations. Lyons was asked if he would apologize for the way some Trump administration officials characterized Good as an agitator, which he declined to do.“I welcome the opportunity to speak to the family in private. But I’m not going to comment on any active investigation,” Lyons said. Lyons said he had seen the video that captured Pretti’s shooting but said he could not comment because of the ongoing investigation.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nMasks worn by immigration officers Democrats painted masked officers as lawless and unaccountable. Republicans said masks are needed to protect officers from doxing. Asked if he would commit to making his officers take off their masks and requiring them to wear “standard uniforms with identifiable badges,” Lyons answered with one word: “No.”Lyons has said repeatedly that he supports officers who feel that they need to wear masks to protect their identities and their families.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nBody cameras being deployed to officersLyons and Scott said thousands of federal immigration officers are already outfitted with body cameras, with more to come. Lyons said the body camera footage caught in Minneapolis would be released to the public. “That’s one thing that I’m committed to is full transparency. And I fully welcome body cameras all across the spectrum in all of our law enforcement activities,” Lyons said. \n    \n        \n    \n\nLyons denies 5-year-old boy was used as baitThe case of Liam Conejo Ramos, who was wearing a bunny hat and Spider-Man backpack while he was surrounded by immigration officers, has sparked controversy over the administration’s crackdown in Minnesota.The boy and his father, Adrian Conejo Arias, who originally is from Ecuador, were detained in a Minneapolis suburb on Jan. 20. Asked about the case, Lyons denied that the boy was used as bait to get one of the parents out of the house, as neighbors and school officials have alleged.“He was obviously upset. We comforted him. The officers actually placed him in one of our vehicles, played his favorite song, favorite music. Then they took him to McDonald’s,” Lyons said. \n    \n        \n    \n\nA DHS funding lapse will threaten the country’s security, officials saidThe congressional hearing took place in the shadow of a looming government shutdown that would only affect the Department of Homeland Security. Democrats are threatening to block funding for the department when it expires unless there are more restraints for ICE and other law enforcement agencies carrying out Trump’s federal immigration agenda.Republican Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi blamed Democrats for a possible shutdown and asked the agency heads whether such a shutdown would make the country less safe. They all answered that it would. “It will have a great impact,” said Lyons. He said a shutdown would particularly harm the department’s task forces on transnational crimes and terrorism.ICE at the World CupLyons was asked if he would agree to pausing ICE operations during this year’s FIFA World Cup.A Democratic lawmaker said visitors were concerned by ICE’s tactics. But Lyons declined to commit to a pause.“ICE is dedicated to ensuring that everyone that visits the facilities will have a safe and secure event,” Lyons said.\n    \n        \n    \n\nQuestions over guarding voting precinctsWith Trump’s call for the federal government to “take over” elections, the ranking member of the committee, Democrat Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, asked the officials to answer if they are involved in any efforts to guard voting precincts, with the midterms set for later this year.“You’ve not been asked to start deploying people for areas anywhere?” Thompson asked.Lyon and Scott each replied, “No, sir.”\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                REBECCA SANTANA\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Santana covers the Department of Homeland Security for The Associated Press.

        "title": "Gov. Tim Walz says federal immigration crackdown in Minnesota could end within days",
        "text": "Plain clothed federal agents pursue a man through the lobby of the Hennepin County Government Center in Minneapolis before tackling and arresting him, on Tuesday, Feb. 10, 2026. (Anthony Souffle/Star Tribune via AP)2026-02-10T21:00:47Z\n                                        MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Gov. Tim Walz said Tuesday that he expects the federal immigration crackdown in Minnesota will end in “days, not weeks and months,” based on his recent conversations with top Trump administration officials.The Democratic governor said at a news conference that he spoke Monday with border czar Tom Homan and with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles on Tuesday morning. Homan took over the Minnesota operation in late January after the second fatal shooting by federal officers and amid growing political backlash and questions about how the operation was being run.“We’re very much in a trust but verify mode,” Walz said. He added that he expected to hear more from the administration “in the next day or so” about the future of what he said has been an “occupation” and a “retribution campaign” against the state. While Walz said he’s hopeful at the moment because “every indication I have is that this thing is winding up,” he added that things could change.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“It would be my hope that Mr. Homan goes out before Friday and announces that this thing is done, and they’re bringing her down and they’re bringing her down in days,” Walz said. “That would be my expectation.”\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nOfficials with the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the governor’s remarks.Walz said he has no reason not to believe Homan’s statement last week that 700 federal officers would leave Minnesota immediately, but the governor added that still left 2,300 on Minnesota’s streets. Homan at the time cited an “increase in unprecedented collaboration” resulting in the need for fewer federal officers in Minnesota, including help from jails that hold inmates who could be deported.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe governor also indicated that he expects the state will get “cooperation on joint investigations” into the shooting deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers, but gave no details. That’s been a point of friction between federal authorities and state investigators, who complain that they have been frozen out of those cases so far with no access to evidence.\n    \n        \n    \n\nWalz called the news conference primarily to denounce the economic impact of the enforcement surge. He spoke at The Market at Malcolm Yards, a food hall where owner Patty Wall said the entire restaurant sector of the local economy has become “collateral damage” from the surge.Matt Varilek, the governor’s employment and economic development commissioner, said Malcolm Yards would normally be bustling, but is now struggling because employees and customers are afraid to come due to the crackdown.“So it is great news, of course, that the posture seems to have changed at the federal level toward their activities here in Minnesota,” Varilek said. “But, as the governor said, it’s a trust-but-verify situation. And frankly, the fear that has been sown, I haven’t really noticed any reduction in that.”Even as Walz was expressing optimism that the crackdown would end soon, federal officers made a highly visible arrest inside the lobby of the main county building in downtown Minneapolis.\n    \n        \n    \n\nAfter a short foot chase, ICE officers grabbed a man who had arrived for a court appearance on charges of possessing over 50 pounds of methamphetamine.The county’s top prosecutor, Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty, protested that the arrest was “disruptive and disturbing to many” and left staffers in the building afraid to leave their offices for fear of being racially profiled.The man could go unpunished on the state drug charges if he’s deported first.“Using local government courthouses for federal civil immigration enforcement interferes with the administration of justice, prevents witnesses from testifying and robs victims of their opportunity to seek justice,” Moriarty said in a statement. She has also objected to earlier arrests by ICE officers of people making court appearances there.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                STEVE KARNOWSKI\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Karnowski covers politics and government from Minnesota for The Associated Press.

        "title": "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledges meetings with Epstein that contradict previous claims",
        "text": "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick listens during an event with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House, Monday, Feb. 2, 2026, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)2026-02-10T16:38:17Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — Under questioning from Democrats Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledged that he had met with Jeffrey Epstein twice after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a child, reversing Lutnick’s previous claim that he had cut ties with the late financier after 2005.Lutnick once again downplayed his relationship with the disgraced financier who was once his neighbor in New York City as he was questioned by Democrats during a subcommittee hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He described their contact as a handful of emails and a pair of meetings that were years apart.“I did not have any relationship with him. I barely had anything to do with him,” Lutnick told lawmakers.But Lutnick is facing calls from several lawmakers for his resignation after the release of case files on Epstein contradicted Lutnick’s claims on a podcast last year that he had decided to “never be in the room” with Epstein again after a 2005 tour of Epstein’s home that disturbed Lutnick and his wife.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe commerce secretary said Tuesday that he and his family actually had lunch with Epstein on his private island in 2012 and he had another hour-long engagement at Epstein’s home in 2011. Lutnick, a member of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet, is the highest-profile U.S. official to face bipartisan calls for his resignation amid revelations of his ties to Epstein. His acknowledgement comes as lawmakers are grasping for what accountability looks like amid the revelations contained in what’s known as the Epstein files.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nIn countries like the United Kingdom, the Epstein files have triggered resignations and the stripping of royal privileges, but so far, U.S. officials have not met the same level of retribution.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nSen. Chris Van Hollen, the Democrat who questioned Lutnick, told him, “There’s not an indication that you yourself engaged in any wrongdoing with Jeffrey Epstein. It’s the fact that you believe that you misled the country and the Congress based on your earlier statements.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nMeanwhile, House members who initiated the legislative effort to force the release of the files are calling for Lutnick to resign. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky called for that over the weekend after emails were released that alluded to the meetings between Lutnick and Epstein.Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, joined Massie in pressuring Lutnick out of office on Monday.“Based on the evidence, he should be out of the Cabinet,” Khanna said.He added, “It’s not about any particular person. In this country, we have to make a decision. Are we going to allow the rich and powerful people who are friends and (had) no problem doing business and showing up with a pedophile who is raping underage girls, are we just going to allow them to skate?”\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                STEPHEN GROVES\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Groves covers Congress for The Associated Press.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto",

This iteration moves away from the vibrant schemes of its predecessors, opting instead for a subdued, studio-ready aesthetic that emphasizes form over flash.The silhouette maintains its unconventional clog structure, utilizing a one-piece molded build that encapsulates the foot in a consistent ivory cream hue. Ventilation is provided through subtle perforations scattered across the upper, while a slim metallic Swoosh lines the lateral panel, adding a touch of refinement without dominating the design. Minimalist branding is stamped on the footbed, keeping the overall presentation understated.While the upper leans into a sculptural minimalism, the sole unit provides the necessary functional and visual contrast. The design features a series of 22 orange pods on the outsole, a signature element of the Mind series that offers both traction and a distinct \"Hyper Crimson\" pop against the neutral base. The result is a silhouette that balances avant-garde construction with wearable simplicity.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "SummaryThe immersive exhibition takes over Portrait Milano from February 8 through February 28Three distinct trails highlight the brand's evolution from historical mountaineering gear to contemporary runwaysRare archive pieces include loans from collector Dapper Dylan and original prototypes by Lionel TerrayMoncler Grenoble has officially unveiled The Beyond Performance Exhibit, a public installation situated within the courtyard of Portrait Milano that explores the technical label's dedicated mountain dimension. Unveiled on February 8, the experience transforms the Milanese venue into a lush forest trail, designed to echo the brand's 1952 origins in Monestier-de-Clermont. The exhibit is structured around a \"mountain mindset,\" guiding visitors through the brand's heritage, performance history, and future ambitions.The journey splits into three specific pathways, beginning with \"The Blue Trail,\" which documents the genesis of the brand. Immersive soundscapes recreate the atmosphere of the 1954 Italian K2 expedition, showcasing the equipment Moncler provided for the climb. Key archival pieces featured here include original sleeping bags, anoraks, and early puffer prototypes developed with French explorer Lionel Terray. The centerpiece of this section is the Karakorum jacket, a silhouette created for the 1954 expedition that remains a core icon of the brand's outerwear offering today.Moving into \"The White Trail,\" the exhibition pivots to ski innovation and the label's history on the slopes. The display contrasts the original ski suit created for the French Olympic team in 1968 against Moncler's official 2026 race suit designed for Brazil's Olympic ski team. This section also highlights the convergence of performance and culture, featuring a 1980s piece by Parisian designer Chantal Thomass and a 1990 Paninaro puffer signed by legendary skier Alberto Tomba. Moncler notes that the exhibition includes pieces loaned from the personal archive of Dapper Dylan.The final leg, \"The Red Trail,\" utilizes a mirrored runway to create an optical illusion representing the brand's future. This area focuses on the \"performance luxury\" era solidified under Remo Ruffini’s stewardship since 2003. It gathers key moments from past runways — ranging from the 2010 New York Fashion Week debut to shows in St. Moritz and Courchevel — and concludes with an exclusive preview of the Aspen Fall/Winter 2026 collection.The Beyond Performance Exhibit is open to the public now through February 28 at Portrait Milano, Corso Venezia 11.

Under the direction of Pharrell Williams, the seasonal offering is designed to address the transitional nature of spring, delivering a hybrid wardrobe that blurs the lines between meticulous tailoring and sportswear attitudes.The collection is defined by a vibrant palette ranging from earth tones to \"French vanilla\" and \"fiery gems,\" applied across adaptive formalwear and technical separates. Heritage details are reimagined through a spring lens: the \"Damier Picnic\" transforms classic gingham into a House motif, while the \"LV Flower X-Ray\" offers a scientific interpretation of floral prints. Construction details include VVN leather tabs on plackets and rivets forming the Monogram. Denim plays a central role, appearing in lightweight blouson sets and overdyed jacquard pants, while track jackets in suede or nylon feature embossed textures.Accessories anchor the whimsical theme, led by a statement bag shaped like a watering can, complete with a perforated spout and VVN leather handle. A classic line of Monogram Denim bags—including the Keepall 50 and Speedy 30B—features intermittent floral jacquard and metal watering can charms. Footwear continues the relaxed narrative with the LV Sunset Thong and Portofino Mule, alongside new sneaker silhouettes like the skate-inspired LV Tilted and the 1960s-referencing LV Buttersoft.

        "text": "SummaryThe Champion x UNDERCOVER collaboration launches on February 14, marking the duo's third partnershipVarious silhouettes are offered, including hoodies, crewnecks, and sweatpants in a neutral paletteDesign updates include beaded logo embroidery, metallic thread tags, and 10oz soft-touch fabricChampion and UNDERCOVER have officially announced their third collaborative collection, set to release as part of the Spring/Summer 2026 season. Drawing from UNDERCOVER's \"but beautiful 4.5… but beautiful for the rebel man\" menswear presentation, the capsule reinterprets classic athletic wear through Jun Takahashi’s avant-garde lens, focusing on unique silhouettes and premium detailing.The collection utilizes Champion’s signature Reverse Weave construction but opts for a softer 10oz sweat material to enhance comfort and drape. The design language balances relaxation with sophisticated grunge; necklines are cut slightly wider than standard, while raw-edge \"cut-off\" detailing adds texture to the hems and cuffs.Branding is executed with a focus on luxury, featuring the Champion logo rendered in beaded embroidery rather than traditional print or patch application. Additionally, the signature jock tag is woven with metallic lame thread for a subtle reflective element. The range consists of five pieces: a Crewneck Sweatshirt, Hooded Sweatshirt, Short Sleeve Sweatshirt, Sweatpants, and Sweatshorts. The color palette remains understated and versatile, offering options in Beige, Bleach Beige, Olive Drab, Grayish Purple, and Midnight Black. The Champion x UNDERCOVER Spring/Summer 2026 collection releases on February 14 via Champion, UNDERCOVER and other retailers.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

We want it to become what you reach for every day,\" Khakis designer Junhyung Seo shared for Hypebeast 100. Among our emerging designers of the year, Junhyung's latest collection reflects the brand's affinity for the '90s through a timeless filter. View this post on InstagramA post shared by Shop Khakis (@shop.khakis) Junhyung, formerly at Thisisneverthat, often employs fading and distressing in a neat balance with Khakis' crisp basics. For example, while the plaid Hawaiian Jacket is heavily patinated at the shoulder, the Shadow Plaid shirt looks just about good as new. The dual nature of the collection is continued in the trousers. The \"Used Blue\" jeans are light-washed and pre-dirtied, while the standard 5P Twill Pant is solid-hued in gray, beige, and yellow.Knitwear pieces, which could otherwise be typical, are rendered with textured fabrics and unconventional details. A zip-up hoodie in mint green waffle fabric boasts contrasting trims, and elsewhere, a usual jersey knit hoodie is altered with metal Henley buttons at the collar. To top off the collection, flat-brimmed caps and intarsia knitted headwear add more '90s character to the range.The first delivery of Khakis SS26 drops tomorrow, February 11, 11:00(KST) at Khakis' Seongsu Store and online.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "SummaryBaby Keem has lifted the veil on his next studio project, dubbed CA$INO, confirmed to drop on February 20Today, the rapper shared a full merchandise capsule for the project as well as a nine-minute Booman documentary short filmKendrick Lamar is confirmed to feature on the tracklist, which spans 12 songsThis is not a drill. Baby Keem has, at last, announced his anticipated sophomore studio album. It's called CA$INO, and it drops in just 10 days.Due out on February 20, Keem's imminent LP is one that has been communally awaited, eyed from all corners of the music scene; every move the rapper made since the release of The Melodic Blue has been carefully observed by a cult-following of fans.Few and far between, the breadcrumbs Keem scattered since the release of his debut studio opus in 2021 have been barely sustainable, but today, he took to socials to give us enough sustenance for the next year and then some. News of The Melodic Blue's follow-up had been circling for about a year now, but became more believable when Keem's name showed up as a headlining act at the imminent Governor's Ball Festival in New York City this summer.Fronted by a bejeweled, black-and-silver aesthetic, CA$INO leans into a vintage Vegas vibe, with the rapper's – and Instagram profile photo – completely revamped to fit the mood. Merchandise includes vinyl box sets and CDs, housed in a casing designed to resemble dice.The cover art, though, is a baby photo of Keem himself, potentially pointing to a deeply personal and introspective audiovisual endeavor that explores themes and topics out of reach on The Melodic Blue. Vulnerability and introspection are further emphasized in a documentary film Keem dropped off today in tandem with the announcement, dubbed Booman, CA$INO Documentary. In the nine-minute short, the musician's family members share more about what Keem was like growing up, and how his childhood shaped his artistry and career trajectory. Booman is a true family affair; Keem's aunts, sisters, and, of course, favorite cousin, Kendrick Lamar, all make appearances. Lamar is confirmed to appear on the 12-song tracklist, showing up on \"Good Flirts\" alongside Momo Boyd. Che Ecru will feature on \"Tubi,\" with Too Short on \"Sex Appeal.\"1. No Security2. Ca$ino3.

        "text": "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin listens during the annual Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference on June 3, 2025, in Anchorage, Alaska. (AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File)2026-02-10T13:18:14Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is expected this week to revoke a scientific finding that long has been the central basis for U.S. action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change, according to a White House official. The Environmental Protection Agency will issue a final rule rescinding a 2009 government declaration known as the endangerment finding. That Obama-era policy determined that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly ahead of an official announcement, confirmed the plans, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. “This week at the White House, President Trump will be taking the most significant deregulatory actions in history to further unleash American energy dominance and drive down costs,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Tuesday.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe endangerment finding is the legal underpinning of nearly all climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet. It is used to justify regulations, such as auto emissions standards, intended to protect against threats made increasingly severe by climate change — deadly floods, extreme heat waves, catastrophic wildfires and other natural disasters in the United States and around the world. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nLegal challenges would be certain for any action that effectively would repeal those regulations, with environmental groups describing the shift as the single biggest attack in U.S. history on federal efforts to address climate change.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nAn EPA spokesperson did not address when the finding would be revoked but reiterated that the agency is finalizing a new rule on it.Brigit Hirsch said via email that the Obama-era rule was “one of the most damaging decisions in modern history” and said EPA “is actively working to deliver a historic action for the American people.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has called climate change a “hoax,” previously issued an executive order that directed EPA to submit a report on “the legality and continuing applicability” of the endangerment finding. Conservatives and some congressional Republicans have long sought to undo what they consider overly restrictive and economically damaging rules to limit greenhouse gases that cause global warming.Lee Zeldin, a former Republican congressman who was tapped by Trump to lead EPA last year, has criticized his predecessors in Democratic administrations, saying they were “willing to bankrupt the country” in an effort to combat climate change. Democrats “created this endangerment finding and then they are able to put all these regulations on vehicles, on airplanes, on stationary sources, to basically regulate out of existence ... segments of our economy,″ Zeldin said in announcing the proposed rule last year. ”And it cost Americans a lot of money.”Peter Zalzal, a lawyer and associate vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund, countered that the EPA will be encouraging more climate pollution, higher health insurance and fuel costs and thousands of avoidable premature deaths. \n    \n        \n    \n\nZeldin’s push “is cynical and deeply damaging, given the mountain of scientific evidence supporting the finding, the devastating climate harms Americans are experiencing right now and EPA’s clear obligation to protect Americans’ health and welfare,” he said.Zalzal and other critics noted that the Supreme Court ruled in a 2007 case that planet-warming greenhouse gases, caused by burning of oil and other fossil fuels, are air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.Since the high court’s decision, in a case known as Massachusetts v. EPA, courts have uniformly rejected legal challenges to the endangerment finding, including a 2023 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.Following Zeldin’s proposal to repeal the rule, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine reassessed the science underpinning the 2009 finding and concluded it was “accurate, has stood the test of time, and is now reinforced by even stronger evidence.” \n    \n        \n    \n\nMuch of the understanding of climate change that was uncertain or tentative in 2009 is now resolved, the NAS panel of scientists said in a September report. “The evidence for current and future harm to human health and welfare created by human-caused greenhouse gases is beyond scientific dispute,” the panel said. ___Follow the AP’s coverage of the Environmental Protection Agency at https://apnews.com/hub/us-environmental-protection-agency___ Associated Press reporter Bill Barrow in Atlanta contributed to this report. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                MATTHEW DALY\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Daly covers climate, environment and energy policy for The Associated Press.

Kennedy Jr., particularly those using mRNA technology, which he has criticized before and after becoming the nation’s top health official.Moderna received what’s called a “refusal-to-file” letter from the FDA that objected to how it conducted a 40,000-person clinical trial comparing its new vaccine to one of the standard flu shots used today. That trial concluded the new vaccine was somewhat more effective in adults 50 and older than that standard shot.The letter from FDA vaccine director Dr. Vinay Prasad said the agency doesn’t consider the application to contain an “adequate and well-controlled trial” because it didn’t compare the new shot to “the best-available standard of care in the United States at the time of the study.” Prasad’s letter pointed to some advice FDA officials gave Moderna in 2024, under the Biden administration, which Moderna didn’t follow.\n    \n        \n    \n\nAccording to Moderna, that feedback said it was acceptable to use the standard-dose flu shot the company had chosen — but that another brand specifically recommended for seniors would be preferred for anyone 65 and older in the study. Still, Moderna said, the FDA did agree to let the study proceed as originally planned.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe company said it also had shared with FDA additional data from a separate trial comparing the new vaccine against a licensed high-dose shot used for seniors.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe FDA “did not identify any safety or efficacy concerns with our product” and “does not further our shared goal of enhancing America’s leadership in developing innovative medicines,” Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIt’s rare that FDA refuses to file an application, particularly for a new vaccine, which requires companies and FDA staff to engage in months or years of discussions.Moderna has requested an urgent meeting with FDA, and noted that it has applied for the vaccine’s approval in Europe, Canada and Australia.In the last year, FDA officials working under Kennedy have rolled back recommendations around COVID-19 shots, added extra warnings to the two leading COVID vaccines — which are made with mRNA technology — and removed critics of the administration’s approach from an FDA advisory panel.Kennedy announced last year that his department would cancel more than $500 million in contracts and funding for the development of vaccines using mRNA.FDA for decades has allowed vaccine makers to quickly update their annual flu shots to target the latest strains by showing that they trigger an immune response in patients. That’s a far more efficient approach than running long-term studies tracking whether patients get the flu and how they fare. In an internal memo last year, Prasad wrote that the streamlined method would no longer be permitted – leading more than a dozen former FDA commissioners to pen an editorial condemning the statements.—-The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

        "text": "Coffee is for sale at a grocery store Monday, Feb. 9, 2026, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Erin Hooley)2026-02-10T13:45:27Z\n                                        NEW YORK (AP) — Shoppers unexpectedly paused their spending in December from November, closing out the holiday shopping season and the year on a lackluster tone.The report, issued by the Commerce Department on Tuesday, surprised economists who were looking for growth despite mounting concerns about slowing job growth, uncertainty about President Donald Trump’s tariffs and other economic headwinds. And it raised questions about shoppers’ ability to spend after they have remained resilient for months despite souring consumer confidence, economists said.Retail sales were flat in December from November, when business was up 0.6%, according to the Commerce Department. Economists were expecting a 0.4% increase for December. The report was delayed because of the 43-day government shutdown.Sales in October fell 0.1%, rose 0.1% in September, but jumped 0.6% in July and August and 1% in June, according to the Commerce Department.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe retail sales figures, which are not adjusted for inflation, showed that many types of businesses posted declines including furniture and home furnishings stores and electronics and appliance retailers.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nAmong the few bright spots: building materials and garden stores, which posted a solid sales increase. Gas stations and food and beverage stores saw small sales gains.The snapshot offers only a partial look at consumer spending and doesn’t include many services, including travel and hotel lodges. But the lone services category – restaurants – registered a dip of 0.1%.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe data comes as U.S. consumer confidence has been souring for months. In fact, confidence declined sharply in January, hitting the lowest level since 2014 as Americans grow increasingly concerned about their financial prospects. “Consumer spending has finally caught up with consumer sentiment, and not in a good way,” Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management in Charlotte, North Carolina, wrote in a report published Tuesday.\n    \n        \n    \n\nHe noted that consumer confidence numbers have been disappointing for months, and shoppers have been complaining about the cost of everything – and yet they kept spending. But he added, “This month’s data show that consumers are no longer relentlessly increasing their level of spending.”Thomas Ryan, North America economist at Capital Economics, also noted the report was worrisome, but given expected stimulus from the bigger tax refund checks, he thinks that consumption at the end of the first quarter of this year “may turn out to be a lot stronger than it currently looks at the start.”Economists will be closely monitoring a slew of economic reports on jobs and prices due out later this week.But the economy is in a confusing place. Growth is robust: Gross domestic product — the nation’s output of goods and services — advanced from July through September at the fastest pace in two years. But the job market is lackluster: Employers have added just 28,000 jobs a month since December.In the 2021-2023 hiring boom that followed COVID-19 lockdowns, by contrast, they were creating 400,000 jobs a month.\n    \n        \n    \n\nWhen the agency releases hiring and unemployment numbers for January on Wednesday, they are expected to show that businesses, government agencies and nonprofits added about 80,000 jobs last month — modest but up from 50,000 in December.Analysts will also be studying consumer price report, to be released Friday. In December, consumer prices matched the 0.3% increase in November. If inflation cools in the coming months, it could increase the likelihood the Federal Reserve will reduce its key interest rate later this year, economists say.Against this backdrop, some chains like Walmart, whose everyday low prices have pulled in shoppers from rivals, are thriving but others struggle.A growing number of retailers are closing stores as companies reorganize under bankruptcy protection or pare down their operations to focus on profitable operations.On Monday, the operator of roughly 180 Eddie Bauer stores across the U.S. and Canada filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, blaming declining sales and a litany of other industry headwinds.\n    \n        \n    \n\nLast month, the parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue said it was seeking bankruptcy protection, buffeted by rising competition and the massive debt it took on to buy its rival in the luxury sector, Neiman Marcus, just over a year ago. A few days later, the parent company said it was closing most of its Saks Off 5th stores.Amazon said earlier this month that it was closing almost all of its Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh locations within days as it narrows its focus on food delivery and its grocery chain, Whole Foods Market.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                ANNE D’INNOCENZIO\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                D’Innocenzio writes about retail, trends, the consumer economy and hourly workers for The Associated Press.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto",

        "title": "How and When the Memory Chip Shortage Will End",
        "text": "If it feels these days as if everything in technology is about AI, that’s because it is. And nowhere is that more true than in the market for computer memory. Demand, and profitability, for the type of DRAM used to feed GPUs and other accelerators in AI data centers is so huge that it’s diverting away supply of memory for other uses and causing prices to skyrocket. According to Counterpoint Research, DRAM prices have risen 80-90 precent so far this quarter.The largest AI hardware companies say they have secured their chips out as far as 2028, but that leaves everybody else—makers of PCs, consumer gizmos, and everything else that needs to temporarily store a billion bits—scrambling to deal with scarce supply and inflated prices.How did the electronics industry get into this mess, and more importantly, how will it get out? IEEE Spectrum asked economists and memory experts to explain. They say today’s situation is the result of a collision between the DRAM industry’s historic boom and bust cycle and an AI hardware infrastructure build-out that’s without precedent in its scale. And, barring some major collapse in the AI sector, it will take years for new capacity and new technology to bring supply in line with demand. Prices might stay high even then.To understand both ends of the tale, you need to know the main culprit in the supply and demand swing, high-bandwidth memory, or HBM.What is HBM?HBM is the DRAM industry’s attempt to short-circuit the slowing pace of Moore’s Law by using 3D chip packaging technology. Each HBM chip is made up of as many as 12 thinned-down DRAM chips called dies. Each die contains a number of vertical connections called through silicon vias (TSVs). The dies are piled atop each other and connected by arrays of microscopic solder balls aligned to the TSVs. This DRAM tower—well, at about 750 micrometers thick, it’s more of a brutalist office-block than a tower—is then stacked atop what’s called the base die, which shuttles bits between the memory dies and the processor.This complex piece of technology is then set within a millimeter of a GPU or other AI accelerator, to which it is linked by as many as 2,048 micrometer-scale connections. HBMs are attached on two sides of the processor, and the GPU and memory are packaged together as a single unit.The idea behind such a tight, highly-connected squeeze with the GPU is to knock down what’s called the memory wall. That’s the barrier in energy and time of bringing the terabytes per second of data needed to run large language models into the GPU. Memory bandwidth is a key limiter to how fast LLMs can run.As a technology, HBM has been around for more than 10 years, and DRAM makers have been busy boosting its capability.As the size of AI models has grown, so has HBM’s importance to the GPU. But that’s come at a cost. SemiAnalysis estimates that HBM generally costs three times as much as other types of memory and constitutes 50 percent or more of the cost of the packaged GPU.Origins of the memory chip shortageMemory and storage industry watchers agree that DRAM is a highly cyclical industry with huge booms and devastating busts. With new fabs costing US $15 billion or more, firms are extremely reluctant to expand and may only have the cash to do so during boom times, explains Thomas Coughlin, a storage and memory expert and president of Coughlin Associates. But building such a fab and getting it up and running can take 18 months or more, practically ensuring that new capacity arrives well past the initial surge in demand, flooding the market and depressing prices.The origins of today’s cycle, says Coughlin, go all the way back to the chip supply panic surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic . To avoid supply-chain stumbles and support the rapid shift to remote work, hyperscalers—data center giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft—bought up huge inventories of memory and storage, boosting prices, he notes.But then supply became more regular and data center expansion fell off in 2022, causing memory and storage prices to plummet. This recession continued into 2023, and even resulted in big memory and storage companies such as Samsung cutting production by 50 percent to try and keep prices from going below the costs of manufacturing, says Coughlin. It was a rare and fairly desperate move, because companies typically have to run plants at full capacity just to earn back their value.After a recovery began in late 2023, “all the memory and storage companies were very wary of increasing their production capacity again,” says Coughlin. “Thus there was little or no investment in new production capacity in 2024 and through most of 2025.”The AI data center boomThat lack of new investment is colliding headlong with a huge boost in demand from new data centers. Globally, there are nearly 2,000 new data centers either planned or under construction right now, according to Data Center Map. If they’re all built, it would represent a 20 percent jump in the global supply, which stands at around 9,000 facilities now.If the current build-out continues at pace, McKinsey predicts companies will spend $7 trillion by 2030, with the bulk of that—$5.2 trillion—going to AI-focused data centers. Of that chunk, $3.3 billion will go toward servers, data storage, and network equipment, the firm predicts.The biggest beneficiary so far of the AI data center boom is unquestionably GPU-maker Nvidia. Revenue for its data center business went from barely a billion in the final quarter of 2019 to $51 billion in the quarter that ended in October 2025. Over this period, its server GPUs have demanded not just more and more gigabytes of DRAM but an increasing number of DRAM chips. The recently released B300 uses eight HBM chips, each of which is a stack of 12 DRAM dies. Competitors’ use of HBM has largely mirrored Nvidia’s. AMD’s MI350 GPU, for example, also uses eight, 12-die chips.With so much demand, an increasing fraction of the revenue for DRAM makers comes from HBM. Micron—the number three producer behind SK Hynix and Samsung—reported that HBM and other cloud-related memory went from being 17 percent of its DRAM revenue in 2023 to nearly 50 percent in 2025.Micron predicts the total market for HBM will grow from $35 billion in 2025 to $100 billion by 2028—a figure larger than the entire DRAM market in 2024, CEO Sanjay Mehrotra told analysts in December. It’s reaching that figure two years earlier than Micron had previously expected. Across the industry, demand will outstrip supply “substantially… for the foreseeable future,” he said.Future DRAM supply and technology“There are two ways to address supply issues with DRAM: with innovation or with building more fabs,” explains Mina Kim, an economist with the Mkecon Insights. “As DRAM scaling has become more difficult, the industry has turned to advanced packaging… which is just using more DRAM.”Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix combined make up the vast majority of the memory and storage markets, and all three have new fabs and facilities in the works. However, these are unlikely to contribute meaningfully to bringing down prices.Micron is in the process of building an HBM fab in Singapore that should be in production in 2027. And it is retooling a fab it purchased from PSMC in Taiwan that will begin production in the second half of 2027. Last month, Micron broke ground on what will be a DRAM fab complex in Onondaga County, N.Y. It will not be in full production until 2030.Samsung plans to start producing at a new plant in Pyeongtaek, South Korea in 2028.SK Hynix is building HBM and packaging facilities in West Lafayette, Indiana set to begin production by the end of 2028, and an HBM fab it’s building in Cheongju should be complete in 2027.Speaking of his sense of the DRAM market, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan told attendees at the Cisco AI Summit last week: “There’s no relief until 2028.”With these expansions unable to contribute for several years, other factors will be needed to increase supply. “Relief will come from a combination of incremental capacity expansions by existing DRAM leaders, yield improvements in advanced packaging, and a broader diversification of supply chains,” says Shawn DuBravac , chief economist for the Global Electronics Association (formerly the IPC). “New fabs will help at the margin, but the faster gains will come from process learning, better [DRAM] stacking efficiency, and tighter coordination between memory suppliers and AI chip designers.”So, will prices come down once some of these new plants come on line? Don’t bet on it. “In general, economists find that prices come down much more slowly and reluctantly than they go up. DRAM today is unlikely to be an exception to this general observation, especially given the insatiable demand for compute,” says Kim.In the meantime, technologies are in the works that could make HBM an even bigger consumer of silicon. The standard for HBM4 can accommodate 16 stacked DRAM dies, even though today’s chips only use 12 dies. Getting to 16 has a lot to do with the chip stacking technology. Conducting heat through the HBM “layer cake” of silicon, solder, and support material is a key limiter to going higher and in repositioning HBM inside the package to get even more bandwidth.SK Hynix claims a heat conduction advantage through a manufacturing process called advanced MR-MUF (mass reflow molded underfill). Further out, an alternative chip stacking technology called hybrid bonding could help heat conduction by reducing the die-to-die vertical distance essentially to zero. In 2024, researchers at Samsung proved they could produce a 16-high stack with hybrid bonding, and they suggested that 20 dies was not out of reach.",

The Swedish giant smashed its own guidance with a record wave of new listeners, crossing 751 million monthly active users as Wrapped once again turned year-end listening habits into a global social media event. At the same time, premium subs hit 290 million, even after back-to-back price hikes in more than 150 markets, showing that users are still willing to pay for the ecosystem they have built inside the app.Under new co-CEOs Gustav Söderström and Alex Norström, Spotify is leaning into its identity as a full-blown audio and media tech platform. Q4 revenue landed around €4.5 billion EUR (approx. $5.3 million USD), operating income jumped to roughly €701 million EUR (approx. $835 million USD) and gross margin set a new high at 33.1% as smarter licensing, tighter podcast spending and better ad yield all kicked in. Wrapped pulled in more than 300 million engaged users and over 630 million social shares, while AI-led tools like the interactive DJ, prompted playlists and an enhanced free tier kept engagement spiking across music, podcasts and audiobooks. For 2026, the company is framing the next chapter as a “year of raising ambition,” targeting 759 million monthly active users and 293 million subscribers as it pushes deeper into video, books and creator-first AI experiences.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "SummaryAmazon is reportedly exploring an AI content marketplace that would let publishers license their work directly to companies building AI productsThe proposed AWS-backed platform would sit alongside tools like Bedrock and Quick Suite as a central hub for usage-based content licensingThe move lands amid mounting legal fights, collapsing referral traffic, and a broader industry shift toward structured AI content marketplaces led by Amazon and MicrosoftAmazon is quietly positioning itself as the broker in one of tech’s messiest battles: how AI systems pay for the culture they train on. According to multiple reports, Amazon Web Services has been circulating internal slides ahead of a publisher-focused conference that describe a dedicated content marketplace, grouped right next to its core AI stack including Bedrock, QuickSight and other generative tools. The idea is simple but loaded: give news outlets and media brands a single venue to register their content, set licensing terms and get paid when AI developers tap it for training or user-facing answers.The project would drop Amazon directly into competition with Microsoft’s newly unveiled Publisher Content Marketplace, which pitches itself as a transparent, usage-based licensing hub for AI builders. Across the reports, publishers are pushing hard for models where compensation scales with how often AI systems rely on their work, rather than flat one-off checks, as they watch AI summaries in search results hammer their traffic and advertising. For Amazon, a marketplace like this would bolt clean, legally licensed data onto its existing AI infrastructure and potentially create a powerful new revenue stream, while promising publishers a more sustainable business path as generative AI becomes the default interface for how audiences consume information online.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

In aging, lymph nodes become fibrotic and structural disorganized, impairing the ability of immune cells to use the lymphatic system to coordinate a response to infection. One possible approach to these problems is the generation of artificial lymph nodes, or at least suitable arrangements of cells that will form themselves into a functional lymph node and connect to the lymphatic system once implanted into the body. A number of different groups have made progress towards this goal, to the point of demonstrating the creation of partially functional lymph nodes in animal studies; the research program noted here is the [&#8230;]",
