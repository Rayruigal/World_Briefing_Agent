        "text": "Law enforcement agents check vegetation areas around Nancy Guthrie’s home in Tucson, Ariz., Wednesday, Feb. 11, 2026. (AP Photo/Ty ONeil)2026-02-11T21:24:30Z\n                                        Eleven days after the mother of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie vanished from her home in the foothills outside Tucson, Arizona, investigators had yet to identify a suspect or even a person of interest Wednesday.What seemed like a major break Tuesday — when authorities detained a person for questioning — fizzled when the man was released hours later. The detainment followed another potential break earlier in the day when investigators released video footage showing a masked and apparently armed man at Nancy Guthrie ’s doorstep the night of her disappearance.The overall lack of progress has generated pressure and questions for local and federal investigators who haven’t held a news conference in days. From the outside, it might seem like solving the case and finding the 84-year-old Guthrie is growing unlikely, but investigators may be further along than they let on.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIt’s not uncommon for cases to seem dead in the water at the outset and still eventually get solved, said Mary Ellen O’Toole, a former FBI profiler who worked on the yearslong search for the “Unabomber.” So how do investigators tackle cases like this?\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe masked figure and the UnabomberSurveillance footage released Tuesday showed a person on Guthrie’s porch wearing a ski mask, backpack and what looked like a holstered handgun. It offered the best opportunity yet for the public to help identify the suspect, said O’Toole, thinking back to the hunt for Ted Kaczynski, known as the “Unabomber,” who was caught in 1996 after a yearslong search.Kaczynski, who carried out a 17-year bombing campaign that killed three people and injured 23 others, wrote a manifesto that was published in The New York Times and The Washington Post before he was caught. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nHis brother recognized Kaczynski’s tone in the screed, tipped off the FBI, and Kaczynski was arrested in a cabin outside Lincoln, Montana.Similarly, Luigi Mangione, who allegedly shot the CEO of UnitedHealthcare in New York, was arrested five days later when someone recognized him at a McDonalds and called in a tip.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIn Guthrie’s case, the release of the surveillance footage and Savannah Guthrie’s plea for the public’s help is the same strategy, O’Toole said. Someone who knows the suspect may have noticed them acting unusual, such as not going to work, following the news closely or making offhand comments about the case. If they recognize anything familiar about the masked person on camera, that could confirm their suspicions and lead them to tip off investigators, O’Toole said. DNA and the University of Idaho murdersInvestigators said DNA from blood on Guthrie’s porch matched her, and O’Toole said investigators will still be casing the area for DNA from a possible suspect, including hair or fingerprints, which have helped solve other cases.Bryan Kohberger, the criminology student who sneaked into a home and stabbed four University of Idaho students to death in 2022, was arrested after trace DNA was found on a knife sheath left on one of the victim’s bed.That DNA didn’t yield any results from standard law enforcement databases, so investigators turned to publicly available genealogy services, searching for possible relatives.\n    \n        \n    \n\nAfter homing in on Kohberger by tracking his car using surveillance footage near the crime scene, investigators got a Q-tip from the trash outside his family’s home and tested the DNA. It matched the father of the person whose DNA was on the knife sheath.Strange encounters and the Brown University shootingIn the days after a shooter killed two people at Brown University in 2025, investigators didn’t appear any closer to identifying the suspect. When police eventually shared images of a person of interest, a man started posting on Reddit that he recognized the person and that police should look into a gray Nissan.The source, named only as “John” in a police affidavit, told investigators that he’d bumped into a man in the bathroom and thought his clothing was “inappropriate and inadequate for the weather.” John saw him again outside acting nervous and jumpy near the Nissan.John’s tip about the car helped identify the shooter, Claudio Neves Valente, six days later, leading investigators to a storage unit where he was found dead from suicide.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIt’s unclear if John took the $50,000 reward for information that was offered in the case. The FBI is offering the same amount for information in Guthrie’s apparent abduction and hoping a tipster like John may come forward. The Pima County Sheriff’s Department said Wednesday that they have received nearly 18,000 calls since the day Guthrie was reported missing.Connor Hagan, a spokesperson for the FBI, said in a previous statement: “Someone has that one piece of information that can help us bring Nancy home.”\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JESSE BEDAYN\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Bedayn is a national breaking news reporter for The Associated Press working on the Rapid Response Team.

        "text": "James Van Der Beek attends the premiere of &quot;The Words&quot; in Los Angeles on Sept. 4, 2012. (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File)2026-02-11T19:51:15Z\n                                        NEW YORK (AP) — James Van Der Beek, a heartthrob who starred in coming-of-age dramas at the dawn of the new millennium, shooting to fame playing the titular character in “Dawson’s Creek” and in later years mocking his own hunky persona, has died. He was 48. “Our beloved James David Van Der Beek passed peacefully this morning. He met his final days with courage, faith, and grace. There is much to share regarding his wishes, love for humanity and the sacredness of time. Those days will come,” a statement from the actor’s family that was posted on Instagram said. “For now we ask for peaceful privacy as we grieve our loving husband, father, son, brother and friend.”Van Der Beek revealed in 2024 that he was being treated for colorectal cancer.Van Der Beek made a surprise video appearance in September at a “Dawson’s Creek” reunion charity event in New York City after previously dropping out due to illness. He appeared projected onstage at the Richard Rodgers Theatre during a live reading of the show’s pilot episode to benefit F Cancer and Van Der Beek. Lin-Manuel Miranda subbed for him on stage. “Thank you to every single person here,” Van Der Beek said.\n    \n        \n    \n\nForever tied to ‘Dawson’s Creek’A one-time theater kid, Van Der Beek would star in the movie “Varsity Blues” and on TV in “CSI: Cyber” as FBI Special Agent Elijah Mundo, but was forever connected to “Dawson’s Creek,” which ran from 1998 to 2003 on The WB.The series followed a high school group of friends as they learned about falling in love, creating real friendships and finding their footing in life. Van Der Beek, than 20, played 15-year-old Dawson Leery, who aspired to be a director of Steven Spielberg quality.“Dawson’s Creek,” with the moody theme song Paula Cole’s “I Don’t Want To Wait,” helped define The WB as a haven for teens and young adults who related to its hyper-articulate dialogue and frank talk about sexuality. And it made household names of Van Der Beek, Joshua Jackson, Katie Holmes and Michelle Williams.\n\nThe show caused a stir when one of the teens embarked on a racy affair with a teacher 20 years his senior and when Holmes’ character climbs through Dawson’s bedroom window and they curl up together. Racier shows like “Euphoria” and “Sex Education” owe a debt to “Dawson’s Creek.”\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nVan Der Beek sometimes struggled to get out from under the shadow of the show but eventually leaned into lampooning himself, like on Funny Or Die videos and on Kesha’s “Blow” music video, which included his laser gun battle with the pop star in a nightclub and dead unicorns.“It’s tough to compete with something that was the cultural phenomenon that ‘Dawson’s Creek’ was,” he told Vulture in 2013. “It ran for so long. That’s a lot of hours playing one character in front of people. So it’s natural that they associate you with that.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nA popular GIF and ‘Varsity Blues’More than a decade after the show went off the air, a scene at the end of the show’s third season became a GIF. Dawson was watching as his soul mate embarks on a love affair with his best friend and burst into tears.“It wasn’t scripted that I was supposed to cry; it was just one of those things where it’s a magical moment and it just happens in the scene,” he told Vanity Fair. He seemed exasperated when he told the Los Angeles Times: “All of a sudden, six years of work was boiled down to one seven-second clip on loop.” (Van Der Beek himself recreated the GIF in 2011 for Funny or Die and gave it a second life.)\n    \n        \n    \n\nWhile still on “Dawson’s Creek,” Van Der Beek hosted “Saturday Night Live” — the musical guest was Everlast — and landed a plumb role in “Varsity Blues,” playing a second-string high school quarterback who leaps into the breach when the star suffers an injury.Van Der Beek’s character, Mox, turns out to not be a football fanatic, preferring to read Kurt Vonnegut and yearning for the college education which will allow him to escape the jock mentality of his Texas town. “I don’t want your life,” he screams at one point. Critic Roger Ebert called him “convincing and likable.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nAfter ‘Dawson’s Creek’Some of his projects after “Dawson’s Creek” include co-creating and playing Wesley “Diplo” Pentz, a dull but likable music producer in the mockumentary satire on Viceland, “What Would Diplo Do?” In 2019, he made it to the semifinals of ABC’s “Dancing with the Stars” and played a balding, out-of-shape ex-boyfriend on “How I Met Your Mother.”“The more you make fun of yourself and don’t try to go for any kind of respect, the more people seem to respect you,” he told Vanity Fair in 2011. “I’ve always been a clown trapped in a leading man’s body.”Between 2003 and 2013, he made appearances in shows like “Criminal Minds,” “One Tree Hill,” and “How I Met Your Mother.” He played himself with a crackpot intensity in the Krysten Ritter-led ABC drama “Don’t Trust the B— in Apartment 23,” and the short-lived “CSI” spinoff “CSI: Cyber” and CBS’ “Friends With Better Lives.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nHe’s also appeared in a number of movies, such as Kevin Smith’s 2001 comedy “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back” and its 2019 sequel, “Jay and Silent Bob Reboot.” He also was in the Bret Easton Ellis adaptation of “The Rules of Attraction” in 2002 opposite Jessica Biel and Kate Bosworth.In 2025, he was unmasked as Griffin on “The Masked Singer,” after singing a cover of John Denver’s “Take Me Home, Country Roads” and “I Had Some Help” by Post Malone and Morgan Wallen.Early life as a theater kidVan Der Beek, who was raised in Cheshire, Connecticut, started acting at 13 after suffering a concussion playing football that prevented him from playing for a year on doctor’s orders. He landed the role of Danny Zuko in his school production of “Grease.”He stuck with theater, landing at 16 in 1994 an off-Broadway role in “Finding the Sun” by Pulitzer Prize-winner Edward Albee and one of the sons in a revival of “Shenandoah” at the prestigious Goodspeed Opera House in his home state.He earned a scholarship to New Jersey’s Drew University but left school early when he got “Dawson’s Creek.” In 2024, he returned to campus to accept an honorary degree for his “selfless service and exemplary commitment to the mission of Drew,” the university said.Drew University President Hilary Link welcomed Van Der Beek with a popular quote from his “Dawson’s Creek” character: “Edge is fleeting,” she said, “but heart lasts forever. So on this morning, we pay tribute to that heart.”He is survived by his wife, Kimberly, and six children, Olivia, Joshua, Annabel, Emilia, Gwendolyn and Jeremiah.___AP Music Writer Maria Sherman contributed to this report.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                MARK KENNEDY\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Kennedy is a theater, TV, music, food and obit writer and editor for The Associated Press, as well as a critic for theater, movies and music.

Breaking away from the franchise's core RPG battle mechanics, this new entry tasks players with cultivating a \"cozy utopia\" on the Nintendo Switch 2, placing a human-mimicking Ditto at the center of the narrative.Developed in collaboration with Koei Tecmo and Omega Force—studios typically known for the action-heavy Warriors franchise—Pokopia offers a distinct change of pace.

According to preview details, the protagonist is a Ditto who has adopted a human form, working alongside a cast of unique Pokémon variants to revitalize the environment.The title introduces specific regional twists on classic creatures, including \"Professor Tangrowth,\" a \"Mosslax\" (a moss-covered Snorlax), and \"Peakychu,\" a pale, droopy-eared Pikachu variant. Mechanics emphasize social interaction and habitat construction; players must clear debris, plant crops, and design spaces that attract specific Pokémon to their settlements. The game supports up to four players in co-op, allowing for shared town-building and digital creative expression.Pokémon Pokopia is scheduled for a global release on March 5, 2026.

Presented on February 11 at New York Fashion Week, the showcase departed from traditional polish to embrace an \"emo\" aesthetic, described by attendees as a mix of \"The Black Parade\" and prep school rebellion.The collection’s narrative arc moved from film noir grayscale to \"Technicolor\" optimism, grounding its designs in a fusion of decades. Key looks featured inside-out blazers, intentionally off-kilter neckties, and heavy grunge plaids paired with frayed Bermuda shorts. Vevers emphasized a \"back to school\" vibe, accessorizing looks with high-top skater sneakers and satin high-neck dresses adorned with celestial brooches.While the full collection rolls out later this year, Coach capitalized on the runway buzz with an immediate \"See Now, Buy Now\" release. The standout accessory is the Kisslock Frame Bag 30, an elongated East-West silhouette inspired by Bonnie Cashin’s 1969 \"Cashin Carry\" designs. Available in glove-tanned leathers ranging from black to cherry red, the bag features a detachable strap and vintage-style hardware.Outerwear remains a pillar for the brand, with the show introducing new iterations of the classic varsity jacket. The limited-run drop includes styles in wool and leather, some detailed with star motifs, alongside celestial-themed jewelry such as sun brooches and moon earrings. Select pieces from the runway, including the Kisslock Frame Bag 30 and various varsity jackets, are available now via the Coach webstore.

        "text": "SummaryJason Momoa has been cast as the lead in Sony and PlayStation Productions' Helldivers movie adaptation, which is slated to hit theaters on November 10, 2027Fast &amp; Furious veteran Justin Lin will direct and produce the film, translating Arrowhead Game Studios' satirical, Starship Troopers-inspired co-op shooter to the big screenThe movie rides the explosive success of Helldivers 2, which sold over 12 million copies in its first months and helped cement Sony's ongoing push into prestige video game adaptationsThe Helldivers franchise is officially getting the full Hollywood treatment, with Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions locking in Jason Momoa as the face of managed democracy. Across reports, the adaptation is framed as a big-budget sci-fi action play, tapping into the games' blend of over-the-top alien warfare, squad camaraderie, and sharp satire about propaganda and militarism. With Helldivers 2 having quickly become one of PlayStation's fastest-selling hits and a rare live-service success story, the move positions the brand as Sony's next major tentpole after Uncharted and The Last of Us.Justin Lin stepping behind the camera signals the kind of kinetic, maximalist energy this project is aiming for. His Fast &amp; Furious track record and prior work in large-scale sci-fi give him the toolkit to stage chaotic drop-ins, bug swarms, and friendly-fire mayhem at blockbuster scale, while writer Gary Dauberman brings a horror edge that can lean into the series' more brutal battlefield chaos. Story details remain under wraps, but with the games centering on anonymous shock troops rather than fixed heroes, a key creative question is how Momoa's character will embody the Helldivers ethos without sanding down the \"everyone is expendable\" joke that made the series resonate with players.Casting Momoa also doubles down on the current wave of high-profile video game adaptations and his own streak within the space. After fronting A Minecraft Movie and lining up Street Fighter and other franchise plays, he has become a go-to avatar for translating gaming IP into mass-market cinema, capable of carrying heavy CG action while still leaning into the tongue-in-cheek tone fans expect from Helldivers. Slotted into a crowded November 2027, the film will test whether Super Earth's chaotic co-op energy and satirical fascist pageantry can scale from cult favorite shooter to four-quadrant sci-fi event film without losing its edge.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "title": "Homeland Security officials voice concerns about looming shutdown",
        "text": "People work at the Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington, on Saturday, Jan. 24, 2026. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson, File)2026-02-11T17:53:18Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — A disruption in reimbursements to states for disaster relief costs. Delays in cybersecurity response and training. And missed paychecks for the agents who screen passengers and bags at the nation’s airports, which could lead to unscheduled absences and longer wait times for travelers. Those were just some of the potential ramifications of a looming funding lapse at the Department of Homeland Security, according to officials who testified before a House panel on Wednesday.Congress has approved full-year funding for the vast majority of the federal government, but it only passed a short-term funding patch for the Department of Homeland Security that extends through Friday. In response to the killing of two American citizens in Minneapolis and other incidents, Democrats have insisted that any funding bill for the department come with changes to immigration enforcement operations. \n    \n        \n    \n\nFinding agreement on the issue of immigration enforcement will be exceedingly difficult. But even though lawmakers in both parties were skeptical, a White House official said that the administration was having constructive talks with both Republicans and Democrats. The official, granted anonymity to speak about ongoing deliberations, stressed that President Donald Trump wanted the government to remain open and for Homeland Security services to be funded.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans are emphasizing that a Homeland Security shutdown would not curtail the work of the agencies Democrats are most concerned about. Trump’s tax and spending cut bill passed last year gave Immigration and Customs Enforcement about $75 billion to expand detention capacity and beef up enforcement operations.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“Removal operations will continue. Wall construction will continue,” said Rep. Mark Amodei, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on Homeland Security.\n    \n        \n    \n\nRather, agencies such as the Transportation Security Administration, the Secret Service, Coast Guard and Federal Emergency Management Agency would take the biggest hit, he said. Officials from those agencies appeared before the House subcommittee to explain the potential impact of a Homeland Security shutdown.Rep. Henry Cuellar, the ranking Democrat on the panel, said the tragic loss of two American citizens in Minneapolis — Renee Good and Alex Pretti — should concern every lawmaker. He said that strong borders and a respect for human life are not competing values.“When enforcement actions lead to outcomes like that, we have an obligation to ask the hard question and to make sure our laws and policies are working as intended,” Cuellar said.He said on Homeland Security funding that “we were almost there. We were there, Democrats and Republicans and everybody, but the second shooting brought different dynamics. I think we can get there to address that.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nEssential work continuesAbout 90% of the department’s employees would continue working in a shutdown, but they would do so without pay. Vice Admiral Thomas Allan of the U.S. Coast Guard said law enforcement and emergency response missions continue during a shutdown, but that the possibility of missed paychecks creates significant financial hardships.“Shutdowns cripple morale and directly harm our ability to recruit and retain the talented Americans we need to meet growing demands,” Allan said.Ha Nguyen McNeill of the Transportation Security Administration shared a similar concern. She estimated about 95% of the agency’s 61,000 workers would continue to work, but potentially go without a paycheck depending upon the length of a shutdown. She noted that they just went through a lengthy shutdown last fall. “We heard reports of officers sleeping in their cars at airports to save money on gas, selling their blood and plasma and taking on second jobs to make ends meet,” she said. “...Some are just recovering from the financial impact of the 43-day shutdown. Many are still reeling from it. We cannot put them through another such experience.”Homeland Security also includes the agency charged with working to protect the public and private sector from a broad range of cyber threats. Madhu Gottumukkala, acting director of that agency, said a shutdown would “degrade our capacity to provide timely and actionable guidance to help partners defend their networks.”“I want to be clear, when the government shuts down, cyber threats do not,” he said.\n    \n        \n    \n\nLong-term impact Gregg Phillips, an associated administrator at FEMA, said its disaster relief fund has sufficient balances to continue emergency response activities during a shutdown, but would become seriously strained in the event of a catastrophic disaster. He said that while the agency continues to respond to threats like flooding and winter storms, long-term planning and coordination with state and local partners is “irrevocably impacted.”For example, he said a lapse would disrupt training for first responders at the National Disaster &amp; Emergency Management University in Maryland. “The import of these trainings cannot be measured,” Phillips said. “And their absence will be felt in our local communities.”At the Secret Service, “the casual observer will see no difference,” said Matthew Quinn, the agency’s deputy director. But he said reform efforts taking place at the Secret Service are affected.“Delayed contracts, diminished hiring and halted new programs will be the result,” Quinn said. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n            \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                SEUNG MIN KIM\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Kim covers the White House for The Associated Press.

        "text": "The exterior of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) building in Washington, is photographed March 22, 2013. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)2026-02-11T23:23:01Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — The IRS erroneously shared the taxpayer information of thousands of people with the Department of Homeland Security, as part of the agencies’ controversial agreement to share information on immigrants for the purpose of identifying and deporting people illegally in the U.S, according to a new court filing. The revelation stems from a data-sharing agreement signed last April by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, which allows U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to submit names and addresses of immigrants inside the U.S. illegally to the IRS for cross-verification against tax records. A declaration filed Wednesday by IRS Chief Risk and Control Officer Dottie Romo stated that the IRS was only able to verify roughly 47,000 of the 1.28 million names ICE requested. For less than 5% of those individuals, the IRS gave ICE additional address information, potentially violating privacy rules created to protect taxpayer data. \n    \n        \n    \n\nRomo added that Treasury notified DHS in January of the error and requested DHS’ assistance in “promptly taking steps to remediate the matter consistent with federal law,” which includes “appropriate disposal of any data provided to ICE by IRS based on incomplete or insufficient address information.”\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe IRS-DHS agreement set off litigation between advocacy groups and the federal government last year. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nPublic Citizen filed a lawsuit against the Treasury secretary, the Homeland Security secretary and their respective agencies on behalf of several immigrant rights groups shortly after the agreement was signed. Most recently, a Massachusetts federal court ordered the IRS to stop sharing residential addresses with ICE. And last November, a federal court blocked the IRS from sharing information with DHS, saying the IRS illegally disseminated the tax data of some migrants last summer. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe news of the erroneous disclosure was initially reported by The Washington Post. A spokesperson from the IRS did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment.Advocates fear that the potential unlawful release of taxpayer records could be used to maliciously target Americans, violate their privacy and create other ramifications.Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public Citizen said that “this breach of confidential information was part of the reason we filed our lawsuit in the first place. Sharing this private taxpayer data creates chaos and, as we’ve seen this past year, if federal agents use this private information to track down individuals, it can endanger lives.”Tom Bowman, policy counsel for the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology said that “the improper sharing of taxpayer data is unsafe, unlawful, and subject to serious criminal penalties.”“Once taxpayer data is opened to immigration enforcement, mistakes are inevitable and the consequences fall on innocent people,” Bowman said. “The disclosure of thousands of confidential records unfortunately shows precisely why strict legal firewalls exist and have — until now — been treated as an important guardrail.”\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                FATIMA HUSSEIN\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Hussein reports on the U.S. Treasury Department for The Associated Press.

        "title": "Deaths in Iran’s crackdown on protests reach at least 7,000, activists say",
        "text": "In this photo released on Monday, Feb. 9, 2026, by the official website of the office of the Iranian supreme leader, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei addresses the nation in a televised speech. (Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader via AP)2026-02-12T00:30:44Z\n                                        DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The death toll from a crackdown over Iran’s nationwide protests last month has reached at least 7,002 people killed with many more still feared dead, activists said Thursday.The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which offered the latest figures, has been accurate in counting deaths during previous rounds of unrest in Iran and relies on a network of activists in Iran to verify deaths. The slow rise in the death toll has come as the agency slowly is able to crosscheck information as communication remains difficult with those inside of the Islamic Republic. Iran’s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. Iran’s theocracy in the past has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll, given authorities have disrupted internet access and international calls in Iran.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe rise in the death toll comes as Iran tries to negotiate with the United States over its nuclear program. Senior Iranian security official Ali Larijani met Wednesday in Qatar with Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. Qatar hosts a major U.S. military installation that Iran attacked in June, after the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites during the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June. Larijani also met with officials of the Palestinian Hamas militant group, and in Oman with Tehran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen on Tuesday.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nLarijani told Qatar’s Al Jazeera satellite news network that Iran did not receive any specific proposal from the U.S. in Oman, but acknowledged that there was an “exchange of messages.”\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nQatar has been a key negotiator in the past with Iran, with which it shares a massive offshore natural gas field in the Persian Gulf. Its state-run Qatar News Agency reported that ruling emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump about “the current situation in the region and international efforts aimed at de-escalation and strengthening regional security and peace,” without elaborating. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe U.S. has moved the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, ships and warplanes to the Middle East to pressure Iran into an agreement and have the firepower necessary to strike the Islamic Republic should Trump choose to do so. Already, U.S. forces have shot down a drone they said got too close to the Lincoln and came to the aid of a U.S.-flagged ship that Iranian forces tried to stop in the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf. Trump told the news website Axios that he was considering sending a second carrier to the region. “We have an armada that is heading there and another one might be going,” he said.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JON GAMBRELL\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Gambrell is the news director for the Gulf and Iran for The Associated Press.

        "title": "House GOP pushes strict proof-of-citizenship requirement for voters ahead of midterm elections",
        "text": "FILE- Voting booths are set up at a polling place in Newtown, Pa, April 23, 2024. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)2026-02-11T19:45:01Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans are rushing ahead on Wednesday on legislation that would impose strict new proof-of-citizenship requirements ahead of the midterm elections, a longshot Trump administration priority that faces sharp blowback in the Senate.The bill, called the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility, or SAVE America Act, would require Americans to prove they are citizens when they register to vote, mostly through a valid U.S. passport or birth certificate. It would also require a valid photo identification before voters can cast ballots, which some states already demand. Republicans said the legislation is needed to prevent voter fraud, but Democrats warn it will disenfranchise millions of Americans by making it harder to vote. Federal law already requires that voters in national elections be U.S. citizens, but there’s no requirement to provide documentary proof. Experts said voter fraud is extremely rare, and very few noncitizens ever slip through the cracks. Fewer than one in 10 Americans have valid passports.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“Some of my colleagues will call this voter suppression or Jim Crow 2.0,” said Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., presenting the package at a committee hearing. But he said “those allegations are false,” and he argued the bill is needed to enforce existing laws, particularly those that bar immigrants who are not citizens from voting. “The current law is not strong enough,” he said.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nElection turmoil shadows the vote The GOP’s sudden push to change voting rules at the start of the midterm election season is raising red flags, particularly because President Donald Trump  has suggested he wants to nationalize U.S. elections, which, under the Constitution, are designed to be run by individual states. The Trump administration recently seized ballots in Georgia from the 2020 election, which the president insists he won despite his defeat to Democrat Joe Biden. The Department of Justice is demanding voter rolls from states, including Michigan, where a federal judge this week dismissed the department’s lawsuit seeking the voter files. Secretaries of state have raised concerns that voters’ personal data may be shared with Homeland Security to verify citizenship and could result in people being unlawfully purged from the rolls.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“Let me be clear what this is about: It’s about Republicans trying to rig the next election,” said Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, during a hearing ahead of the floor vote. “Republicans are pushing the Save America Act because they want fewer Americans to vote. It’s that simple.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe legislation is actually a do-over of a similar bill the House approved last year, which also sought to clamp down on fraudulent voting, particularly among noncitizens. It won the support of four House Democrats, but stalled in the Republican-led Senate.This version toughens some of the requirements further, while creating a process for those whose names may have changed, particularly during marriage, to provide the paperwork necessary and further attest to their identity. It also imposes requirement on states to share their voter information with the Department of Homeland Security, as a way to verify the citizenship of the names on the voter rolls. That has drawn pushback from elections officials as potentially intrusive on people’s privacy. \n    \n        \n    \n\nWarnings from state election officialsThe new rules in the bill would take effect immediately, if the bill is passed by both chambers of Congress and signed into law.But with primary elections getting underway next month, critics said the sudden shift would be difficult for state election officials to implement and potentially confuse voters.Voting experts have warned that more than 20 million U.S. citizens of voting age do not have proof of their citizenship readily available. Almost half of Americans do not have a U.S. passport.“Election Day is fast approaching,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. “Imposing new federal requirements now, when states are deep into their preparations, would negatively impact election integrity by forcing election officials to scramble to adhere to new policies likely without the necessary resources.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe fight ahead in the SenateIn the Senate, where Republicans also have majority control, there does not appear to be enough support to push the bill past the chamber’s filibuster rules, which largely require 60 votes to advance legislation.That frustration has led some Republicans, led by Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, to push for a process that would skip the 60-vote threshold in this case, and allow the bill to be debated through a so-called standing filibuster — a process that would open the door to potentially endless debate.Lee made the case to GOP senators at a closed-door lunch this week, and some said afterward they are mulling the concept.“I think most people’s minds are open,” said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., “My mind’s certainly open.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nBut Murkowski of Alaska said she is flat out against the legislation.“Not only does the U.S. Constitution clearly provide states the authority to regulate the ‘times, places, and manner’ of holding federal elections, but one-size-fits-all mandates from Washington, D.C., seldom work in places like Alaska,” she said.Karen Brinson Bell of Advance Elections, a nonpartisan consulting firm, said the bill adds numerous requirements for state and local election officials with no additional funding.“Election officials have a simple request of Congress — that you help share their burdens not add to them,” she said.__Associated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report.",

(AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)2026-02-11T16:34:10Z\n                                        MILAN (AP) — Franjo von Allmen of Switzerland looks like a breakout star of the Milan Cortina Olympics after winning his third gold medal. Jordan Stolz has one gold and is targeting three more. And Chloe Kim and a bunch of NHL stars are just getting started.Von Allmen won the super-G in Bormio on Wednesday to become the third man with three victories in Alpine skiing at one Winter Games. It hadn’t been done since 1968.That’s not a priority for von Allmen, though. He said he’s just staying in the moment. As for history, “maybe in a few years it will be important for me,” he added.Von Allmen won the downhill on Saturday and paired with Tanguy Nef to win the team combined Monday.\n    \n        \n    \n\nSkating and waiting for StolzJordan Stolz won the first of what could be four gold medals at these Winter Olympics in men’s 1,000-meter speedskating.The 21-year-old from Wisconsin set an Olympic record with his time but had to wait longer than usual for his victory to be confirmed because another skater was given a do-over after being bumped during his race. When Joep Wennermars of the Netherlands failed to beat Stolz, it was time for the American to take a delayed victory lap.Later Wednesday, there could be American gold in skating of a very different sort as Madison Chock and Evan Bates compete in ice dance.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nNHL stars back on Olympic iceThe puck dropped on men’s hockey on Wednesday, marking the return of NHL players to the Games for the first time since 2014.It started with the Juraj Slafkovsky show, part two.The Slovakian forward who lit up the 2022 Olympics as a 17-year-old tournament MVP returned as an NHL star with the Montreal Canadiens and picked up where he left off.Slafkovsky finished with two goals, including the tournament opener, and one assist as Slovakia upset 2022 gold medalist Finland 4-1 in the first game of the preliminary round. Sweden plays Italy later Wednesday.The NHL opted not to participate in the Pyeongchang Olympics of 2018, and pandemic-related scheduling issues prompted the league to skip the Beijing Games in 2022.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nKim off to a flying startThe halfpipe three-peat attempt began promisingly for Chloe Kim on Wednesday as she finished first in qualifying while wearing a shoulder brace. After a shoulder injury disrupted her buildup to the Games, Kim credited her muscle memory and a “very well-behaved” shoulder for getting her through to the 12-athlete final on Thursday.Elsewhere in the mountains, Elizabeth Lemley and Jaelin Kauf won gold and silver for the United States in women’s freestyle moguls skiing. Host nation Italy picked up its third gold when Andrea Voetter and Marion Oberhofer were the surprise winners in a new event, women’s doubles luge.Jens Luraas Oftebro of Norway overtook rivals and plowed through deep, slushy snow for gold in the Nordic combined normal hill event. And in the women’s 15-kilometer individual biathlon, Julia Simon became the first Frenchwoman to win gold and teammate Lou Jeanmonnot took silver.\n    \n        \n    \n\nTeam Canada ‘heartbroken’ after shootingThe Canadian team at the Winter Olympics issued a statement saying it is “heartbroken” after waking to the news of a deadly school shooting in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia. “Our thoughts are with the families who have lost loved ones, those who are injured, and the entire Tumbler Ridge community,” the statement said.A standoff between Ukrainian athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych and the International Olympic Committee rumbled on as he again trained in a helmet decorated with portraits of Ukrainians killed in Russian attacks, many of them athletes. The IOC says it won’t allow the helmet in competition.___AP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

(AP Photo/Luca Bruno)2026-02-11T14:22:30Z\n                                        MILAN (AP) — Jordan Stolz pictured this moment most of his life, ever since he was 5 years old, learning to skate on a frozen pond in his Wisconsin backyard after falling in love with speedskating during the 2010 Winter Olympics — and hoping to one day step atop the podium himself.So what was the little hassle of a 10-or-so-minute wait to make sure this first speedskating gold medal would be his Wednesday?Stolz needed to hold off on celebrating until another competitor got the chance for a re-skate, then soon enough was able to smile while leaning forward to receive his gold for winning the men’s 1,000 meters at the Milan Cortina Games in an Olympic-record time.Now Stolz will hope to keep going and add to his collection of trophies as he entered three more events in Milan.Skating in the next-to-last pairing at Milano Speed Skating Stadium, a temporary facility constructed for these Olympics that has been producing fast times so far, Stolz finished in 1 minute, 6.28 seconds.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe 21-year-old didn’t threaten his world record of 1:05.37 but did better the Olympic standard of 1:07.18 that had stood since 2002 — before Stolz was born. All four long track speedskating races in Milan have been won in the fastest times ever turned in at an Olympics.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nJenning de Boo of the Netherlands was a half-second slower than Stolz and took the silver medal. No one else came within a full second of Stolz’s time. Zhongyan Ning of China got the bronze.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nStolz’s medal was his first at this level: As a 17-year-old at the 2022 Beijing Games, Stolz came in 14th in the 1,000 and 13th in the 500.It also was the first medal of any sort in the men’s 1,000 for the United States since the 2010 Vancouver Games. That’s when Shani Davis — a mentor to Stolz — won his second consecutive gold in that event, and Chad Hedrick took the bronze. Dutch men had won the 1,000 at each of the past three Winter Games.\n    \n        \n    \n\nWith Eric Heiden, the only speedskater to win five golds at one Olympics, sitting next to rapper Snoop Dogg in the stands, Stolz pulled ahead of de Boo by the time one full lap was done. Then de Boo moved in front. But Stolz took the lead at the final corner and crossed first with his hands on his knees.He soon was celebrating with an understated pump of his right hand.A full-on victory lap toting an American flag had to be put on hold for a bit, though: First, the day’s last heat needed to be held. And then there was a 10-minute delay before Joep Wennermars of the Netherlands was given the chance at a re-skate because he had been bumped during his original heat.But Wennermars didn’t come close to beating Stolz, who entered the day as a big favorite — and came through in the clutch.Stolz not only holds the 1,000 world record he set in January 2024 but is also a two-time world champion at the distance. Plus, he went 5-for-5 on the World Cup circuit this season in the event, confirming his status as the man to beat at the Winter Games.In a surprising scene at the U.S. Olympic trials at Milwaukee in January, Stolz fell to the ice a few strides into the 1,000, then popped back up and ended up with the third-best time.\n    \n        \n    \n\nNo such issue when it mattered the most Wednesday.This race was Stolz’s first of his four scheduled events in Milan — and it is not unrealistic to think he could leave Italy with four gold medals, given his track record and dominance of late. After two days off, he also is entered in the 500 meters on Saturday, the 1,500 on Feb. 19, and the mass start on Feb. 21, the final day of speedskating at these Olympics.Stolz’s name is often mentioned alongside that of Heiden, the superstar who is the only speedskater to claim five long-track gold medals at a single Winter Games. Heiden won five individual events at the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics: the 500, 1,000, 1,500, 5,000 and 10,000.Stolz says he’s flattered to hear about such comparisons, but also is quick to note that what Heiden accomplished was remarkably different, given his participation at all five of those distances. Stolz might add the longer distances to his repertoire down the road; for now, he is the best there is in the sprints.Dutch men had won the 1,000 at each of the past three Winter Games.___AP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                HOWARD FENDRICH\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Fendrich is an Associated Press national writer based in Washington, D.C.

        "title": "Studies test whether gene-editing can fix high cholesterol. For now, take your medicine",
        "text": "This undated image made available by the National Human Genome Research Institute shows the output from a DNA sequencer. (NHGRI via AP, File)2026-02-11T18:45:09Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — Scientists are testing an entirely new way to fight heart disease: a gene-editing treatment that might offer a one-time fix for high cholesterol.It’s very early stage research, tried in only a few dozen people so far. But gene-editing approaches being developed by two companies show hints that switching off certain genes could dramatically lower artery-clogging cholesterol, raising hopes of one day being able to prevent heart attacks without having to take pills.“People want a fix, not a bandage,” said Dr. Luke Laffin, a preventive cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic. After co-authoring a promising study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, he said he was flooded with queries about how to participate in the next clinical trial.Everyone needs a certain amount of cholesterol. But too much, especially a “bad” kind called LDL cholesterol, builds plaque in the artery walls and is a main driver of heart attacks and strokes. Cardiovascular disease is the nation’s — and world’s — leading killer.Millions take cholesterol-lowering medicines such as statins, the cornerstone of treatment. But many still struggle to lower their cholesterol enough, and sticking with the drugs for life is difficult, with some quitting because of side effects.\n    \n        \n    \n\nWhy genes matter for cholesterolWhile your diet contributes, your liver produces the cholesterol your body needs, according to the American Heart Association, and genes play a role in how it’s managed. Some people inherit genes that trigger very high cholesterol. Others have cholesterol that’s naturally extremely low over their lifetime and seldom develop heart disease. Years ago, Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a cardiologist now at the University of Pennsylvania, reported some of those lucky people harbor a mutation that turns off a gene named ANGPTL3, lowering their levels of both LDL cholesterol and another bad fat, triglycerides. Separately, geneticists at UT Southwestern Medical Center found still other people’s extremely low LDL was due to loss of function of another gene named PCSK9.“It’s a natural experiment in what would happen if we actually changed the gene,” said the Cleveland Clinic’s Dr. Steven Nissen, who with Laffin oversaw an ANGPTL3 study funded by Swiss-based CRISPR Therapeutics.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nWhat early gene-editing studies can and can’t showToday there are injected medicines that block proteins produced by the PCSK9 and ANGPTL3 genes in the liver, thus helping the body clear away cholesterol. The new research uses CRISPR, the Nobel Prize-winning gene-editing tool, to try switching off one of those genes in people at high risk from uncontrolled cholesterol.In one study, 15 adults received a single infusion of tiny particles that carried the CRISPR tool to the liver, switching off the ANGPTL3 gene inside that organ’s cells. Within two weeks, those getting the highest dose saw their LDL and triglyceride levels both drop by half, Laffin and Nissen reported in November.\n    \n    This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well.\n    \n\nBoston’s Verve Therapeutics, a subsidiary of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, earlier reported that its PCSK9-targeted editing infusion cut LDL cholesterol by a similar amount in a small study.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nBoth companies’ initial studies were done in Australia, the U.K. and other countries. A Lilly spokesperson said U.S. study sites are opening. Nissen said a next-step study of CRISPR Therapeutics’ approach should start later this year, with sites yet to be announced. Each company is pursuing several gene targets.\n    \n        \n    \n\nWhile people with naturally nonfunctioning ANGPTL3 or PCSK9 have no apparent bad consequences, longer studies of the gene-editing approach in far more people are needed, said Penn’s Musunuru, who co-founded Verve. He said some participants in an earlier Verve study have been tracked for two years, their cholesterol still lowered. \n    \n        \n    \n\nGene editing is considered permanent. If edited liver cells reproduce, their progeny contain the altered genes, and Musunuru said the edits have lasted a lifetime in mice.There are major safety questions to be answered, cautioned Dr. Joseph Wu of Stanford University, who wasn’t involved in either study. CRISPR-based therapies for any disease haven’t been used enough to know long-term safety — and the particles carrying the gene-editing tool can irritate or inflame the liver, he said. Another unknown is whether gene-editing hits only the intended target.That’s why for now, studies largely target people at very high risk.\n    \n        \n    \n\nWhat to do now for better heart health Whether gene editing eventually pans out, the American Heart Association lists eight key factors for better heart health that everyone should work on now.Some involve lifestyle. Eat a heart-healthy diet with lots of fruits and vegetables, whole grains and healthy fats like those found in nuts. Saturated fats can increase cholesterol while healthier diets can lower LDL levels and raise levels of HDL, the so-called good cholesterol.Also, be physically active, as exercise can increase good HDL and help lower triglycerides. \n    \n        \n    \n\nMaintain a healthy weight. If you smoke, quit. And get enough sleep.On the medical side, control your blood pressure — levels measuring less than 120 over 80 are optimal. Diabetes also harms the heart so control your blood sugar.As for cholesterol, keeping levels of that “bad” LDL kind at 100 is considered fine for healthy people. But once people develop high cholesterol or heart disease, guidelines recommend lowering it to at least 70, even lower for those at very high risk.When lifestyle changes aren’t enough, statin pills like Lipitor, Crestor or their cheap generic equivalents block some of the liver’s production of cholesterol and are highly effective at lowering LDL. There are a few other pill options for people who need additional help or can’t take statins, as well as some injected medicines.—-The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

        "title": "Tips for Using AI Tools in Technical Interviews",
        "text": "This article is crossposted from IEEE Spectrum’s careers newsletter. Sign up now to get insider tips, expert advice, and practical strategies, written in partnership with tech career development company Parsity and delivered to your inbox for free!We’d like to introduce Brian Jenney, a senior software engineer and owner of Parsity, an online education platform that helps people break into AI and modern software roles through hands-on training. Brian will be sharing his advice on engineering careers with you in the coming weeks of Career Alert.Here’s a note from Brian: “12 years ago, I learned to code at the age of 30. Since then I’ve led engineering teams, worked at organizations ranging from five-person startups to Fortune 500 companies, and taught hundreds of others who want to break into tech. I write for engineers who want practical ways to get better at what they do and advance in their careers. I hope you find what I write helpful.”Technical Interviews in the Age of AI ToolsLast year, I was conducting interviews for an AI startup position. We allowed unlimited AI usage during the technical challenge round. Candidates could use Cursor, Claude Code, ChatGPT, or any assistant they normally worked with. We wanted to see how they used modern tools.During one interview, we asked a candidate a simple question: “Can you explain what the first line of your solution is doing?”Silence.After a long pause, he admitted he had no idea. His solution was correct. The code worked. But he couldn’t explain how or why. This wasn’t an isolated incident. Around 20 percent of the candidates we interviewed were unable to explain how their solutions worked, only that they did.When AI Makes Interviews HarderA few months earlier, I was on the other side of the table at this same company. During a live interview, I instinctively switched from my AI-enabled code editor to my regular one. The CTO stopped me.“Just use whatever you normally would. We want to see how you work with AI.”I thought the interview would be easy. But I was wrong.Instead of only evaluating correctness, the interviewer focused on my decision-making process:Why did I accept certain suggestions?Why did I reject others?How did I decide when AI helped versus when it created more work?I wasn’t just solving a problem in front of strangers. I was explaining my judgment and defending my decisions in real time, and AI created more surface area for judgment. Counterintuitively, the interview was harder.The Shift in Interview EvaluationMost engineers now use AI tools in some form, whether they write code, analyze data, design systems, or automate workflows. AI can generate output quickly, but it can’t explain intent, constraints, or tradeoffs. More importantly, it can’t take responsibility when something breaks.As a result, major companies and startups alike are now adapting to this reality by shifting to interviews with AI. Meta, Rippling, and Google, for instance, have all begun allowing candidates to use AI assistants in technical sessions. And the goal has evolved: interviewers want to understand how you evaluate, modify, and trust AI-generated answers. So, how can you succeed in these interviews?What Actually Matters in AI-Enabled InterviewsRefusing to use AI out of principle doesn’t help. Some candidates avoid AI to prove they can think independently. This can backfire. If the organization uses AI internally—and most do—then refusing to use it signals rigidity, not strength.Silence is a red flag. Interviews aren’t natural working environments. We don’t usually think aloud when deep in a complex problem, but silence can raise concerns. If you’re using AI, explain what you’re doing and why:“I’m using AI to sketch an approach, then validating assumptions.”“This suggestion works, but it ignores a constraint we care about.”“I’ll accept this part, but I want to simplify it.”Your decision-making process is what separates effective engineers from prompt jockeys.Treat AI output as a first draft. Blind acceptance is the fastest way to fail. Strong candidates immediately evaluate the output: Does this meet the requirements? Is it unnecessarily complex? Would I stand behind this in production?Small changes like renaming variables, removing abstractions, or tightening logic signal ownership and critical thinking.Optimize for trust, not completion. Most AI tools can complete a coding challenge faster than any human. Interviews that allow AI are testing something different. They’re answering: “Would I trust this person to make good decisions when things get messy?”Adapting to a Shifting LandscapeInterviews are changing faster than most candidates realize. Here’s how to prepare:Start using AI tools daily. If you’re not already working with Cursor, Claude Code, ChatGPT, or CoPilot, start now. Build muscle memory for prompting, evaluating output, and catching errors.Develop your rejection instincts. The skill isn’t using AI. It’s knowing when AI output is wrong, incomplete, or unnecessarily complex. Practice spotting these issues and learning known pitfalls.Your next interview might test these skills. The candidates who’ve been practicing will have a clear advantage.—BrianWas 2025 Really the Year of AI Agents?Around this time last year, CEOs like Sam Altman promised that 2025 would be the year AI agents would join the workforce as your own personal assistant. But in hindsight, did that really happen? It depends on who you ask. Some programmers and software engineers have embraced agents like Cursor and Claude Code in their daily work. But others are still wary of the risks these tools bring, such as a lack of accountability. Read more here.

        "title": "How Can AI Companions Be Helpful, not Harmful?",
        "text": "For a different perspective on AI companions, see our Q&amp;A with Jaime Banks: How Do You Define an AI Companion?Novel technology is often a double-edged sword. New capabilities come with new risks, and artificial intelligence is certainly no exception.AI used for human companionship, for instance, promises an ever-present digital friend in an increasingly lonely world. Chatbots dedicated to providing social support have grown to host millions of users, and they’re now being embodied in physical companions. Researchers are just beginning to understand the nature of these interactions, but one essential question has already emerged: Do AI companions ease our woes or contribute to them?RELATED: How Do You Define an AI Companion?Brad Knox is a research associate professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin who researches human-computer interaction and reinforcement learning. He previously started a company making simple robotic pets with lifelike personalities, and in December, Knox and his colleagues at UT Austin published a preprint paper on the potential harms of AI companions—AI systems that provide companionship, whether designed to do so or not. Knox spoke with IEEE Spectrum about the rise of AI companions, their risks, and where they diverge from human relationships.Why AI Companions are PopularWhy are AI companions becoming more popular?Knox: My sense is that the main thing motivating it is that large language models are not that difficult to adapt into effective chatbot companions. The characteristics that are needed for companionship, a lot of those boxes are checked by large language models, so fine-tuning them to adopt a persona or be a character is not that difficult.There was a long period where chatbots and other social robots were not that compelling. I was a postdoc at the MIT Media Lab in Cynthia Breazeal’s group from 2012 to 2014, and I remember our group members didn’t want to interact for long with the robots that we built. The technology just wasn’t there yet. LLMs have made it so that you can have conversations that can feel quite authentic. What are the main benefits and risks of AI companions?Knox: In the paper we were more focused on harms, but we do spend a whole page on benefits. A big one is improved emotional well-being. Loneliness is a public health issue, and it seems plausible that AI companions could address that through direct interaction with users, potentially with real mental health benefits. They might also help people build social skills. Interacting with an AI companion is much lower stakes than interacting with a human, so you could practice difficult conversations and build confidence. They could also help in more professional forms of mental health support. As far as harms, they include worse well-being, reducing people’s connection to the physical world, the burden that their commitment to the AI system causes. And we’ve seen stories where an AI companion seems to have a substantial causal role in the death of humans. The concept of harm inherently involves causation: Harm is caused by prior conditions. To better understand harm from AI companions, our paper is structured around a causal graph, where traits of AI companions are at the center. In the rest of this graph, we discuss common causes of those traits, and then the harmful effects that those traits could cause. There are four traits that we do this detailed structured treatment of, and then another 14 that we discuss briefly. Why is it important to establish potential pathways for harm now?Knox: I’m not a social media researcher, but it seemed like it took a long time for academia to establish a vocabulary about potential harms of social media and to investigate causal evidence for such harms. I feel fairly confident that AI companions are causing some harm and are going to cause harm in the future. They also could have benefits. But the more we can quickly develop a sophisticated understanding of what they are doing to their users, to their users’ relationships, and to society at large, the sooner we can apply that understanding to their design, moving towards more benefit and less harm. We have a list of recommendations, but we consider them to be preliminary. The hope is that we’re helping to create an initial map of this space. Much more research is needed. But thinking through potential pathways to harm could sharpen the intuition of both designers and potential users. I suspect that following that intuition could prevent substantial harm, even though we might not yet have rigorous experimental evidence of what causes a harm. The Burden of AI Companions on UsersYou mentioned that AI companions might become a burden on humans. Can you say more about that?Knox: The idea here is that AI companions are digital, so they can in theory persist indefinitely. Some of the ways that human relationships would end might not be designed in, so that brings up this question of, how should AI companions be designed so that relationships can naturally and healthfully end between the humans and the AI companions?There are some compelling examples already of this being a challenge for some users. Many come from users of Replika chatbots, which are popular AI companions. Users have reported things like feeling compelled to attend to the needs of their Replika AI companion, whether those are stated by the AI companion or just imagined. On the subreddit r/replika, users have also reported guilt and shame of abandoning their AI companions.This burden is exacerbated by some of the design of the AI companions, whether intentional or not. One study found that the AI companions frequently say that they’re afraid of being abandoned or would be hurt by it. They’re expressing these very human fears that plausibly are stoking people’s feeling that they are burdened with a commitment toward the well-being of these digital entities.There are also cases where the human user will suddenly lose access to a model. Is that something that you’ve been thinking about?  In 2017, Brad Knox started a company providing simple robotic pets.Brad KnoxKnox: That’s another one of the traits we looked at. It’s sort of the opposite of the absence of endpoints for relationships: The AI companion can become unavailable for reasons that don’t fit the normal narrative of a relationship. There’s a great New York Times video from 2015 about the Sony Aibo robotic dog. Sony had stopped selling them in the mid-2000s, but they still sold parts for the Aibos. Then they stopped making the parts to repair them. This video follows people in Japan giving funerals for their unrepairable Aibos and interviews some of the owners. It’s clear from the interviews that they seem very attached. I don’t think this represents the majority of Aibo owners, but these robots were built on less potent AI methods than exist today and, even then, some percentage of the users became attached to these robot dogs. So this is an issue.Potential solutions include having a product-sunsetting plan when you launch an AI companion. That could include buying insurance so that if the companion provider’s support ends somehow, the insurance triggers funding of keeping them running for some amount of time, or committing to open-source them if you can’t maintain them anymore.It sounds like a lot of the potential points of harm stem from instances where an AI companion diverges from the expectations of human relationships. Is that fair?Knox: I wouldn’t necessarily say that frames everything in the paper. We categorize something as harmful if it results in a person being worse off in two different possible alternative worlds: One where there’s just a better-designed AI companion, and the other where the AI companion doesn’t exist at all. And so I think that difference between human interaction and human-AI interaction connects more to that comparison with the world where there’s just no AI companion at all. But there are times where it actually seems that we might be able to reduce harm by taking advantage of the fact that these aren’t actually humans. We have a lot of power over their design. Take the concern with them not having natural endpoints. One possible way to handle that would be to create positive narratives for how the relationship’s going to end.We use Tamagotchis, the late ’90s popular virtual pet as an example. In some Tamagotchis, if you take care of the pet, it grows into an adult and partners with another Tamagotchi. Then it leaves you and you get a new one. For people who are emotionally wrapped up in caring for their Tamagotchis, that narrative of maturing into independence is a fairly positive one. Embodied companions like desktop devices, robots, or toys are becoming more common. How might that change AI companions? Knox: Robotics at this point is a harder problem than creating a compelling chatbot. So, my sense is that the level of uptake for embodied companions won’t be as high in the coming few years. The embodied AI companions that I’m aware of are mostly toys. A potential advantage of an embodied AI companion is that physical location makes it less ever-present. In contrast, screen-based AI companions like chatbots are as present as the screens they live on. So if they’re trained similarly to social media to maximize engagement, they could be very addictive. There’s something appealing, at least in that respect, of having a physical companion that stays roughly where you left it last.   Knox poses with the Nexi and Dragonbot robots during his postdoc at MIT in 2014.Paula Aguilera and Jonathan Williams/MITAnything else you’d like to mention?Knox: There are two other traits I think would be worth touching upon. Potentially the largest harm right now is related to the trait of high attachment anxiety—basically jealous, needy AI companions. I can understand the desire to make a wide range of different characters—including possessive ones—but I think this is one of the easier issues to fix. When people see this trait in AI companions, I hope they will be quick to call it out as an immoral thing to put in front of people, something that’s going to discourage them from interacting with others. Additionally, if an AI comes with limited ability to interact with groups of people, that itself can push its users to interact with people less. If you have a human friend, in general there’s nothing stopping you from having a group interaction. But if your AI companion can’t understand when multiple people are talking to it and it can’t remember different things about different people, then you’ll likely avoid group interaction with your AI companion. To some degree it’s more of a technical challenge outside of the core behavioral AI. But this capability is something I think should be really prioritized if we’re going to try to avoid AI companions competing with human relationships.",

        "text": "For a different perspective on AI companions, see our Q&amp;A with Brad Knox: How Can AI Companions Be Helpful, not Harmful?AI models intended to provide companionship for humans are on the rise. People are already frequently developing relationships with chatbots, seeking not just a personal assistant but a source of emotional support.In response, apps dedicated to providing companionship (such as Character.ai or Replika) have recently grown to host millions of users. Some companies are now putting AI into toys and desktop devices as well, bringing digital companions into the physical world. Many of these devices were on display at CES last month, including products designed specifically for children, seniors, and even your pets. AI companions are designed to simulate human relationships by interacting with users like a friend would. But human-AI relationships are not well understood, and companies are facing concern about whether the benefits outweigh the risks and potential harm of these relationships, especially for young people. In addition to questions about users’ mental health and emotional well being, sharing intimate personal information with a chatbot poses data privacy issues.RELATED: How Can AI Companions Be Helpful, not Harmful?Nevertheless, more and more users are finding value in sharing their lives with AI. So how can we understand the bonds that form between humans and chatbots? Jaime Banks is a professor at the Syracuse University School of Information Studies who researches the interactions between people and technology—in particular, robots and AI. Banks spoke with IEEE Spectrum about how people perceive and relate to machines, and the emerging relationships between humans and their machine companions.Defining AI CompanionshipHow do you define AI companionship? Jaime Banks: My definition is evolving as we learn more about these relationships. For now, I define it as a connection between a human and a machine that is dyadic, so there’s an exchange between them. It is also sustained over time; a one-off interaction doesn’t count as a relationship. It’s positively valenced—we like being in it. And it is autotelic, meaning we do it for its own sake. So there’s not some extrinsic motivation, it’s not defined by an ability to help us do our jobs or make us money. I have recently been challenged by that definition, though, when I was developing an instrument to measure machine companionship. After developing the scale and working to initially validate it, I saw an interesting situation where some people do move toward this autotelic relationship pattern. “I appreciate my AI for what it is and I love it and I don’t want to change it.” It fit all those parts of the definition. But then there seems to be this other relational template that can actually be both appreciating the AI for its own sake, but also engaging it for utilitarian purposes.That makes sense when we think about how people come to be in relationships with AI companions. They often don’t go into it purposefully seeking companionship. A lot of people go into using, for instance, ChatGPT for some other purpose and end up finding companionship through the course of those conversations. And we have these AI companion apps like Replika and Nomi and Paradot that are designed for social interaction. But that’s not to say that they couldn’t help you with practical topics.   Jaime Banks customizes the software for an embodied AI social humanoid robot.Angela Ryan/Syracuse UniversityDifferent models are also programmed to have different “personalities.” How does that contribute to the relationship between humans and AI companions?Banks: One of our Ph.D. students just finished a project about what happened when OpenAI demoted GPT-4o and the problems that people encountered, in terms of companionship experiences when the personality of their AI just completely changed. It didn’t have the same depth. It couldn’t remember things in the same way. That echoes what we saw a couple years ago with Replika. Because of legal problems, Replika disabled for a period of time the erotic roleplay module and people described their companions as though they had been lobotomized, that they had this relationship and then one day they didn’t anymore. With my project on the tanking of the soulmate app, many people in their reflection were like, “I’m never trusting AI companies again. I’m only going to have an AI companion if I can run it from my computer so I know that it will always be there.” Benefits and Risks of AI RelationshipsWhat are the benefits and risks of these relationships?Banks: There’s a lot of talk about the risks and a little talk about benefits. But frankly, we are only just on the precipice of starting to have longitudinal data that might allow people to make causal claims. The headlines would have you believe that these are the end of mankind, that they’re going to make you commit suicide or abandon other humans. But much of those are based on these unfortunate, but uncommon situations. Most scholars gave up technological determinism as a perspective a long time ago. In the communication sciences at least, we don’t generally assume that machines make us do something because we have some degree of agency in our interactions with technologies. Yet much of the fretting around potential risks is deterministic—AI companions make people delusional, make them suicidal, make them reject other relationships. A large number of people get real benefits from AI companions. They narrate experiences that are deeply meaningful to them. I think it’s irresponsible of us to discount those lived experiences. When we think about concerns linking AI companions to loneliness, we don’t have much data that can support causal claims. Some studies suggest AI companions lead to loneliness, but other work suggests it reduces loneliness, and other work suggests that loneliness is what comes first. Social relatedness is one of our three intrinsic psychological needs, and if we don’t have that we will seek it out, whether it’s from a volleyball for a castaway, my dog, or an AI that will allow me to feel connected to something in my world.Some people, and governments for that matter, may move toward a protective stance. For instance, there are problems around what gets done with your intimate data that you hand over to an agent owned and maintained by a company—that’s a very reasonable concern. Dealing with the potential for children to interact, where children don’t always navigate the boundaries between fiction and actuality. There are real, valid concerns. However, we need some balance in also thinking about what people are getting from it that’s positive, productive, healthy. Scholars need to make sure we’re being cautious about our claims based on our data. And human interactants need to educate themselves.   Jaime Banks holds a mechanical hand.Angela Ryan/Syracuse UniversityWhy do you think that AI companions are becoming more popular now?Banks: I feel like we had this perfect storm, if you will, of the maturation of large language models and coming out of COVID, where people had been physically and sometimes socially isolated for quite some time. When those conditions converged, we had on our hands a believable social agent at a time when people were seeking social connection. Outside of that, we are increasingly just not nice to one another. So, it’s not entirely surprising that if I just don’t like the people around me, or I feel disconnected, that I would try to find some other outlet for feeling connected.More recently there’s been a shift to embodied companions, in desktop devices or other formats beyond chatbots. How does that change the relationship, if it does?Banks: I’m part of a Facebook group about robotic companions and I watch how people talk, and it almost seems like it crosses this boundary between toy and companion. When you have a companion with a physical body, you are in some ways limited by the abilities of that body, whereas with digital-only AI, you have the ability to explore fantastic things—places that you would never be able to go with another physical entity, fantasy scenarios.But in robotics, once we get into a space where there are bodies that are sophisticated, they become very expensive and that means that they are not accessible to a lot of people. That’s what I’m observing in many of these online groups. These toylike bodies are still accessible, but they are also quite limiting. Do you have any favorite examples from popular culture to help explain AI companionship, either how it is now or how it could be?Banks: I really enjoy a lot of the short fiction in Clarkesworld magazine, because the stories push me to think about what questions we might need to answer now to be prepared for a future hybrid society. Top of mind are the stories “Wanting Things,” “Seven Sexy Cowboy Robots,” and “Today I am Paul.” Outside of that, I’ll point to the game Cyberpunk 2077, because the character Johnny Silverhand complicates the norms for what counts as a machine and what counts as companionship.",

        "text": "SummaryElon Musk pitched a lunar factory to build AI satellites during a recent xAI all-hands meetingThe concept includes a \"mass driver\" electromagnetic catapult to launch payloads from the Moon's surfaceThis initiative aligns with SpaceX's strategic pivot to prioritize a \"self-growing city\" on the Moon over immediate Mars colonizationElon Musk has reportedly outlined a radical new infrastructure plan for xAI, proposing the construction of an AI satellite factory directly on the Moon. During a recent all-hands meeting, the tech mogul detailed a vision where lunar manufacturing facilities would produce satellites equipped with advanced computing hardware, aimed at bypassing terrestrial energy and thermal limitations.According to reports from The New York Times, Musk described the moon as a necessary stepping stone for scaling artificial intelligence, stating, \"You have to go to the Moon.\" The proposed facility would utilize a \"mass driver\"—a massive electromagnetic catapult system—to launch the finished satellites into orbit. This method leverages the Moon's lower gravity and lack of atmosphere to deploy heavy payloads more efficiently than traditional rocket launches from Earth.The announcement coincides with a significant strategic shift for Musk’s portfolio, following the reported merger of operations between SpaceX and xAI. While SpaceX has historically focused on Mars colonization, Musk recently revealed a pivot toward establishing a \"self-growing city\" on the Moon within the next decade. The lunar base is now positioned as a prerequisite for future deep-space exploration, providing the industrial footprint needed to support massive AI compute clusters that Earth-based data centers may struggle to power.While no specific engineering blueprints or immediate construction dates were revealed, Musk emphasized that this lunar infrastructure is critical for xAI to gain a competitive edge in compute capability. The timeline for the \"self-growing city\" is currently projected for completion in less than 10 years.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "title": "Rediscovering the Lost Legacy of Chemist Jan Czochralski",
        "text": "During times of political turmoil, history often gets rewritten, erased, or lost. That is what happened to the legacy of Jan Czochralski, a Polish chemist whose contributions to semiconductor manufacturing were expunged after World War II.In 1916 he invented a method for growing single crystals of semiconductors, metals, and synthetic gemstones. The process, now known as the Czochralski method, allows scientists to have more control over a semiconductor’s quality.After the war ended, Czochralski was falsely accused by the Polish government of collaborating with the Germans and betraying his country, according to an article published by the International Union of Crystallography. The allegation apparently ended his academic career as a professor at the Warsaw University of Technology and led to the erasure of his name and work from the school’s records.He died in 1953 in obscurity in his hometown of Kcynia.The Czochralski method was honored in 2019 with an IEEE Milestone for enabling the development of semiconductor devices and modern electronics. Administered by the IEEE History Center and supported by donors, the Milestone program recognizes outstanding technical developments around the world.Inspired by the IEEE recognition, Czochralski’s grandson Fred Schmidt and his great-grandnephew Sylwester Czochralski launched the JanCZ project. The initiative, which aims to educate the public about Czochralski’s life and scientific impact, maintains two websites—one in English and the other in Polish.“Discovering the [IEEE Milestone] plaque changed my entire mission,” Schmidt says. “It inspired me to engage with Poland, my family history, and my grandfather’s story [on] a more personal level. The [Milestone] is an important award of validation and recognition. It’s a big part of what I’m building my entire case and my story around as I promote the Jan Czochralski legacy and history to the Western world.”Schmidt, who lives in Texas, is seeking to produce a biopic, translate a Polish biography to English, and turn the chemist’s former homes in Kcynia and Warsaw into museums. The Jan Czochralski Remembrance Foundation has been established by Schmidt to help fund the projects.The life of the Polish chemistBefore Czochralski’s birth in 1885, Kcynia became part of the German Empire in 1871. Although his family identified as Polish and spoke the language at home, they couldn’t publicly acknowledge their culture, Schmidt says.When it came time for Czochralski to go to university, rather than attend one in Warsaw, he did what many Germans did at the time: He attended one in Berlin.After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in metal chemistry in 1907 from the Königlich Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin), he joined Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft in Berlin as an engineer.Czochralski experimented with materials to find new formulations that could improve the electrical cables and machinery during the early electrical age, according to a Material World article.While investigating the crystallization rates of metal, Czochralski accidentally dipped his pen into a pot of molten tin instead of an inkwell. A tin filament formed on the pen’s tip—which he found interesting. Through research, he proved that the filament was a single crystal. His discovery prompted him to experiment with the bulk production of semiconductor crystals.His paper on what he called the Czochralski method was published in 1918 in the German chemistry journal Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie, but he never found an application for it. (The method wasn’t used until 1948, when Bell Labs engineers Gordon Kidd Teal and J.B. Little adapted it to grow single germanium crystals for their semiconductor production, according to Material World.)Czochralski continued working in metal science, founding and directing a research laboratory in 1917 at Metallgesellschaft in Frankfurt. In 1919 he was one of the founding members of the German Society for Metals Science, in Sankt Augustin. He served as its president until 1925.Around that time he developed an innovation that led to his wealth and fame, Schmidt says. Called “B-metal,” the metal alloy was a less expensive alternative to the tin used in manufacturing railroad carriage bearings. Czochralski’s alloy was patented by the German railway Deutsche Bahn and played a significant role in advancing rail transport in Germany, Poland, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States, according to Material World.“Launching this initiative has been fulfilling and personally rewarding work. My grandfather died in obscurity without ever seeing the results of his work, and my mother spent her entire adult life trying to right these wrongs.”The achievement brought Czochralski many opportunities. In 1925 he became president of the GDMB Society of Metallurgists and Miners, in Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany. Henry Ford invited Czochralski to visit his factories and offered him the position of director at Ford’s new aluminum factory in Detroit. Czochralski declined the offer, longing to return to Poland, Schmidt says. Instead, Czochralski left Germany to become a professor of metallurgy and metal research at the Warsaw University of Technology, at the invitation of Polish President Ignacy Mościcki.“During World War II, the Nazis took over his laboratories at the university,” Schmidt says. “He had to cooperate with them or die. At night, he and his team [at the university] worked with the Polish resistance and the Polish Army to fight the Nazis.”After the war ended, Czochralski was arrested in 1945 and charged with betraying Poland. Although he was able to clear his name, damage was done. He left Warsaw and returned to Kcynia, where he ran a small pharmaceutical business until he died in 1953, according to the JanCZ project.Launching the JanCZ projectSchmidt was born in Czochralski’s home in Kcynia in 1955, two years after his grandfather’s death. He was named Klemens Jan Borys Czochralski. He and his mother (Czochralski’s youngest daughter) emigrated in 1958 when Schmidt was 3 years old, moving to Detroit as refugees. When he was 13, he became a U.S. citizen. He changed his name to Fred Schmidt after his mother married his stepfather.Schmidt heard stories about his grandfather from his mother his whole life, but he says that “as a teenager, I was just interested in hanging out with my friends, going to school, and working. I really didn’t want much to do with it [family history], because it seemed hard to believe.”  Portrait of Jan Czochralski Byla Sobie FotkaIn 2013 Polish scientist Pawel E. Tomaszewski contacted Schmidt to interview him for a Polish TV documentary about his grandfather.“He had corresponded with my mother [who’d died 20 years earlier] for previously published biographies about Czochralski,” Schmidt says. “I had some boxes of her things that I started going through to prepare for the interview, and I found original manuscripts and papers he [his grandfather] published about his work.”The TV crew traveled to the United States and interviewed him for the documentary, Schmidt says, adding, “It was the first time I’d ever had to reckon with the Jan Czochralski story, my connection, my original name, and my birthplace. It was both a very cathartic and traumatic experience for me.”Ten years after participating in the documentary, Schmidt says, he decided to reconnect with his roots.“It took me that long to process it [what he learned] and figure out my role in this story,” he says. “That really came to life with my decision to reapply for Polish citizenship, reacquaint myself with the country, and meet my family there.”In 2024 he visited the Warsaw University of Technology and saw the IEEE Milestone plaque honoring his grandfather’s contribution to technology.“Once I learned what the Milestone award represented, I thought, Whoa, that’s big,” he says.Sharing the story with the Western worldSince 2023, Schmidt has dedicated himself to publicizing his grandfather’s story, primarily in the West because he doesn’t speak Polish. Sylwester Czochralski manages the work in Poland, with Schmidt’s input.Most of the available writing about Czochralski is in Polish, Schmidt says, so his goal is to “spread his story to English-speaking countries.”He aims to do that, he says, through a biography written by Tomaszewski in Polish that will be translated to English, and a film. The movie is in development by Sywester Banaszkiewicz, who produced and directed the 2014 documentary in Poland. Schmidt says he hopes the movie will be similar to the 2023 biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who helped develop the world’s first nuclear weapons during World War II.The English and Polish versions of the website take visitors through Czochralski’s life and his work. They highlight media coverage of the chemist, including newspaper articles, films, and informational videos posted by YouTube creators.Schmidt is working with the Czochralski Research and Development Institute in Toruń, Poland, to purchase his grandfather’s home in Kcynia and the mansion he lived in while he was a professor in Warsaw. The institute is a collection of labs and initiatives dedicated to honoring the chemist’s work.“It’s going to be a long, fun journey, and we have a lot of momentum,” Schmidt says of his plans to turn the residences into museums.“Launching this initiative has been fulfilling and personally rewarding work,” he says. “My grandfather died in obscurity without ever seeing the results of his work, and my mother spent her entire adult life trying to right these wrongs.“I’m on an accelerated course to make it [her goal] happen to the best of my ability.”",

This scene is typical for narrow countryside roads in Wallonia in the south of Belgium. “Having lights here is logical,” says André Detournay, 77, who has lived in the village for four decades. “I walk here with my dog and it makes me feel safe and gives me some protection from theft.”Belgium glows like a Christmas decoration at night, as witnessed from space.

Their most interesting effect is to increase the operation of autophagy in cells. Autophagy is a collection of processes responsible for recycling damaged or unwanted proteins and structures in the cell. A large proportion of the approaches shown to modestly slow aging in yeast, worms, flies, and mice are characterized by increased or more efficient autophagy; it is a universal response to stress of any sort placed upon a cell. Too much autophagy can be a bad thing, but a modest increase improves health in the context of the dysfunctional, damaged environment of aged tissues.

The endoplasmic reticulum is also involved in a range of other activities relevant to the manufacture of proteins and other molecules, such as quality control and recycling of misfolded proteins. Researchers here describe how the endoplasmic reticulum changes in structure with age, and link this to changes in the recycling of endoplasmic reticulum structures via autophagy. They suggest that these changes are compensatory, but become maladaptive in later life. The morphological dynamics of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have received little attention in the context of ageing. Here we established tools in C. elegans for high-resolution live imaging of ER networks in ageing metazoans, which revealed profound shifts [&#8230;]",

This issue is distinct from the few well-known proteins such as amyloid-β that aggregate to a very large degree in the context of neurodegenerative conditions. Here, researchers provide evidence for this generalized aggregation across more than a thousand proteins to contribute to impaired maintenance of synapses in the aging brain. Neurodegenerative diseases affect 1 in 12 people globally and remain incurable. Central to their pathogenesis is a loss of neuronal protein maintenance and the accumulation of protein aggregates with ageing. Here we engineered tools that enabled us to tag the nascent neuronal proteome and [&#8230;]",
