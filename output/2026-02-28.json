(AP Photo/Tom Brenner)2026-02-27T19:55:34Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Friday that the U.S. is in talks with Havana and raised the possibility of a “friendly takeover of Cuba” without offering any details on what he meant.Speaking to reporters outside the White House as he left for a trip to Texas, Trump said Secretary of State Marco Rubio was in discussions with Cuban leaders “at a very high level.” “The Cuban government is talking with us,” the president said. “They have no money. They have no anything right now. But they’re talking to us, and maybe we’ll have a friendly takeover of Cuba.”He added: “We could very well end up having a friendly takeover of Cuba.”Trump didn’t clarify his comments but seemed to indicate that the situation with Cuba, a communist-run island that has been among Washington’s bitterest adversaries for decades, was coming to a critical point. The White House did not respond to requests for more information Friday.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe president also said that Cuba “is, to put it mildly, a failed nation” and “they want our help.”His remarks came two days after the Cuban government reported that a Florida-registered speedboat carrying 10 armed Cubans from the U.S. opened fire on soldiers off the island’s north coast. Four of the armed Cubans were killed, and six were injured in responding gunfire, according to Cuba’s government. One Cuban official also was injured. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nCuba has been on Trump’s mind since at least early January, after U.S. forces ousted one of Havana’s closest allies, Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolás Maduro. Trump suggested in the aftermath of that raid that military action in Cuba might not be necessary because the island’s economy was weak enough — particularly in the absence of oil shipments from Venezuela that stopped after Maduro was taken into custody — to soon collapse on its own. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“We’ve had a lot of years of dealing with Cuba. I’ve been hearing about Cuba since I’m a little boy. But they’re in big trouble,” he said Friday. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThen, noting the exile community from the island living in the U.S., Trump said there could be something coming that “I think (is) very positive for the people that were expelled, or worse, from Cuba and live here.” He did not elaborate.The U.S. has maintained a strict trade embargo on Cuba since 1962, the year after a failed, CIA-sponsored invasion of the island at the Bay of Pigs. Trump nonetheless indicated earlier this month that talks with Cuban officials were underway.Cuba’s government confirmed earlier this week that it was communicating with U.S. officials following the shooting of the American boat. Rubio has said the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Coast Guard are investigating what happened. An executive order that Trump signed in late January pledged to impose tariffs on countries providing oil to Cuba, threatening to further cripple a country already plagued by a deepening energy crisis, though U.S. authorities have since indicated that oil from Venezuela can be sold to Cuban interests in some cases. Carlos Fernández de Cossío, Cuba’s deputy foreign minister, posted on social media Friday that “the US maintains its fuel embargo against Cuba in full force, and its impact as a form of collective punishment is unwavering.” \n    \n        \n    \n\n“Nothing announced in recent days changes this reality,” he wrote on X. “The possibility of conditional sales to the private sector already existed and does not alleviate the impact on the Cuban population.”Meanwhile, 40-plus U.S. civil society organizations sent a letter to Congress on Friday asking that it “press the Trump administration to reverse its aggressive policy towards Cuba” and saying that efforts to cut oil shipments to the Caribbean island would spark a humanitarian collapse.Signees included the Alliance of Baptists, ActionAid USA and the Presbyterian Church.“Policies that deliberately impose hunger and mass hardship on millions of civilians constitute a form of collective punishment, and as such are a grave violation of international humanitarian law,” the letter reads.___Associated Press writer Dánica Coto contributed from San José, Costa Rica.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                WILL WEISSERT\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Weissert covers the White House for The Associated Press.

        "text": "The flag of the International Atomic Energy Agency flies in front of its headquarters during an IAEA Board of Governors meeting in Vienna, Austria, on Feb. 6, 2023. (AP Photo/Heinz-Peter Bader, File)2026-02-27T14:06:14Z\n                                        VIENNA (AP) — Iran has not allowed the United Nations nuclear watchdog to access nuclear facilities affected by the 12-day war in June, according to a confidential report by the watchdog circulated to member states and seen Friday by The Associated Press. The report from the International Atomic Energy Agency stressed that therefore it “cannot verify whether Iran has suspended all enrichment-related activities,” or the “size of Iran’s uranium stockpile at the affected nuclear facilities.”The IAEA report on Friday warned that due to the continued lack of access to any of Iran’s four declared enrichment facilities, the agency “cannot provide any information on the current size, composition or whereabouts of the stockpile of enriched uranium in Iran.” The report stressed that the “loss of continuity of knowledge over all previously declared nuclear material at affected facilities in Iran needs to be addressed with the utmost urgency.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nAccording to the IAEA, Iran maintains a stockpile of 440.9 kilograms (972 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% purity — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThat stockpile could allow Iran to build as many as 10 nuclear bombs, should it decide to weaponize its program, IAEA director general Rafael Grossi warned in a recent interview with the AP. He added that it doesn’t mean that Iran has such a weapon.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nSuch highly enriched nuclear material should normally be verified every month, according to the IAEA’s guidelines.Iran long has insisted its program is peaceful, but the IAEA and Western nations say Tehran had an organized nuclear weapons program up until 2003.The IAEA also reported that it had observed, through the analysis of commercially available satellite imagery, “regular vehicular activity around the entrance to the tunnel complex at Isfahan.”The facility in Isfahan, some 350 kilometers (215 miles) southeast of Tehran, was mainly known for producing the uranium gas that is fed into centrifuges to be spun and purified.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIsrael has struck buildings at the Isfahan nuclear site, among them a uranium conversion facility. The U.S. also struck Isfahan with missiles during the war last June.The IAEA also reported that through the analysis of commercially-available satellite imagery, it has observed “activities being conducted at some of the affected nuclear facilities, including the enrichment facilities at Natanz and Fordow,” but it added that “without access to these facilities it is not possible for the Agency to confirm the nature and the purpose of the activities.”The confidential IAEA report also said Friday that Iran did provide access to IAEA inspectors “to each of the unaffected nuclear facilities at least once since the military attacks of June 2025, with the exception of Karun Nuclear Power Plan, which is in the early stages of construction and does not contain nuclear material.”",

        "text": "U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee poses for a photo during an interview in Jerusalem, Wednesday, Aug. 20, 2025. (AP Photo/Ohad Zwigenberg, File)2026-02-27T11:40:53Z\n                                        TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The U.S. Embassy in Israel on Friday told its staff that it could leave the country and urged anyone considering departure to do so immediately, as the threat of an American strike on Iran looms.U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee told embassy employees in an email that discussions with officials in Washington had led to a decision authorizing departures for those who wished to leave.The email was recounted to The Associated Press by someone involved with the U.S. mission who wasn’t authorized to share details. Sent before 10:30 a.m., it urged staff considering departure to do so quickly, advising them to to focus initially on getting any flight out of Israel and to then make their way to Washington.“Those wishing to take AD should do so TODAY,” Huckabee wrote, using an acronym for “authorized departure.”“While there may be outbound flights over the coming days, there may not be,” he added.\n    \n        \n    \n\nHuckabee said that there was no need for panic, but for those desiring to leave, it was important to make plans soon.The email came a day after Iran and the United States walked away from nuclear negotiations without a deal. Airlines such as Netherlands-based KLM have already announced plans to suspend flights out of Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International Airport, and other embassies have also made plans for authorized departures from Israel and neighboring countries.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nAustralia on Wednesday “directed the departure of all dependents of Australian officials posted to Israel in response to the deteriorating security situation in the Middle East.” India and several European countries with missions in Iran advised citizens to avoid travel to the country as well.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nOn a town hall meeting Friday after the email was sent, Huckabee told staff that he was encouraging airlines to keep flying.The departure authorizations signal a new level of contingency planning as a massive fleet of U.S. aircraft and warships mass in the Middle East.\n    \n        \n    \n\nBadr al-Busaidi, Oman’s foreign minister who is mediating in the negotiations, said that there had been significant progress made on Thursday, though officials from Iran and the United States haven’t announced steps forward.Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Thursday offered no specifics, but said “what needs to happen has been clearly spelled out from our side.”___ Metz reported from Ramallah, West Bank.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                SAM MEDNICK\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Mednick is an AP correspondent for Israel and the Palestinian Territories.

(AP Photo/Angelina Katsanis, File)2026-02-27T18:34:32Z\n                                        ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Friday that 30 more people have been indicted for allegedly taking part in an anti-immigration enforcement protest at a Minnesota church.In a social media post Friday, Bondi said 25 people had been arrested with more arrests to come later in the day.“YOU CANNOT ATTACK A HOUSE OF WORSHIP. If you do so, you cannot hide from us — we will find you, arrest you, and prosecute you,” she wrote in the post. “This Department of Justice STANDS for Christians and all Americans of faith.”Others arrested include independent journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort, and prominent local activist Nekima Levy Armstrong, who was the subject of a doctored photo posted by the White House showing her crying during her arrest. They have pleaded not guilty to civil rights charges.In total, 39 people have been charged over the church protest and all are charged with conspiracy against religious freedom and interfering with the right of religious freedom.\n    \n        \n    \n\nProtesters descended on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Jan. 18 after learning that one of the church’s pastors also serves as an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official. The protest drew swift condemnation from Trump administration officials and conservative leaders for disrupting a Sunday service.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe church protest came amid a tense couple months for Minnesota, where the Trump administration sent thousands of federal officers for Operation Metro Surge after a series of government fraud cases where the majority of defendants had Somali roots. Federal officers frequently deployed tear gas for crowd control in neighborhood clashes with activists, often detaining them along with immigrants.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nOn Jan. 7, a federal officer shot and killed 37-year-old mother Renee Good in south Minneapolis. In another fatal shooting one week after the church protest, a federal officer killed 37-year-old nurse Alex Pretti.\n    \n        \n    \n\nNationwide demonstrations erupted in response, followed by a change in Operation Metro Surge’s leadership and the eventual wind-down of the immigration enforcement operation in mid-February.Since then, the Twin Cities have grappled with the impact to communities and the local economy. The city of Minneapolis said it suffered an impact of $203.1 million due to the operation, with tens of thousands of residents in need of urgent relief assistance.",

        "text": "Saw Ba Mya James, an ethnic Karen refugee from Myanmar, stands for a portrait in St. Paul, Minn., on Jan. 28, 2026. (AP Photo/Jack Brook)2026-02-27T06:00:56Z\n                                        ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Their family spent years opposing Venezuela’s socialist system.The government retaliated by sending men to beat the father, a state oil company worker whom it accused of being uncooperative. Other relatives were threatened.The situation became so untenable that the family fled the country for the United States in 2021 after it obtained refugee status, according to one of the daughters, a 24-year-old clothing salesperson who was interviewed by The Associated Press.The six siblings and their parents settled in Minnesota in 2023, living peaceful lives until the Trump administration said it was casting new scrutiny on refugees. One priority is those admitted to the U.S. under former President Joe Biden, whom the government accuses of prioritizing quantity over detailed screening and vetting, with an initial focus on 5,600 refugees who settled in Minnesota and are not yet permanent residents, making them particularly vulnerable. \n    \n        \n    \n\nLast month, three masked officers got out of a black SUV with tinted windows outside a St. Paul apartment complex, handcuffed the Venezuelan woman and her mother and told them their legal status was under review, according to the woman, who asked for anonymity for fear of retaliation.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nOverturning years of precedent, immigration authorities have arrested or questioned dozens of refugees in Minnesota, attorneys and advocates say, with more detentions likely to come nationwide.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nIn January, a federal judge ordered a temporary halt to the arrest and detention of refugees in Minnesota while a lawsuit challenging the “revetting” continues. The judge ordered the immediate release of all refugees detained in Minnesota, and those taken to Texas. Three refugees told The Associated Press that whatever happens, the rounds of inconclusive interviews with immigration authorities well after they thought their status was safe has them questioning their futures in the U.S. and living in constant fear. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe young woman from Venezuela hasn’t returned to her job at a clothing factory. A man who fled persecution in Myanmar won’t walk on the streets of Minneapolis without a letter from his church appealing for immigrants to “be treated humanely.” A Congolese refugee arrested in St. Paul despite her refugee status says “everything that’s happened feels like a movie.”A change in US treatment of refugeesWelcoming refugees has been a source of bipartisan agreement in the U.S. since Congress passed the Refugee Act with overwhelming support in 1980.The act helped make refugee applications some of the immigration system’s most heavily scrutinized. Government decisions that someone was persecuted for who they are or what they believe are rarely second-guessed, and revisiting refugee status that’s already been granted is a major blow to legal tradition, advocates say. “They’ve been heavily vetted and were admitted by the government with approval,” said Beth Oppenheim, chief executive officer of HIAS, a major refugee aid group. Once a refugee is admitted to the U.S. through the resettlement program, the only way to strip them of their status is to prove that they should never have been admitted, Oppenheim said. That is why the Trump administration is interviewing people again, she said. \n    \n        \n    \n\nMatthew Tragesser, a spokesman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in a written statement refugees “are REQUIRED to be subject to a full inspection after a year within the United States.”“This is not novel or discretionary; it is a clear requirement in law,” he wrote.While it is correct that refugees must apply for green cards one year after admission — a change of status that brings a renewed layer of scrutiny — the administration is breaking with decades of tradition by revisiting initial decisions to admit people as refugees, and then detaining them while they are under review.“Arresting, detaining, and rescreening refugees are all new changes which will inflict grave harm on vulnerable populations,” said Smita Dazzo, deputy director of U.S. programs at HIAS.\n    \n        \n    \n\nVenezuela to Minnesota to Houston and backIn January, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement took the Venezuelan women to Houston on a flight where migrants were shackled at the wrists and ankles and forbidden from talking. The daughter said she was told she was there for green card interviews and isolated in a cold room with no food, water or anything warm to cover her. She said she refused to sign documents without an attorney present. “They told us, ‘Your status is worthless. You’re illegal,’” she said. “What we went through is something I wouldn’t wish on anyone … We were supposed to arrive in this country with refugee status, and we thought we would be protected here. But right now, at this moment, it is quite the opposite.”The women were released after successfully filing habeas corpus petitions in federal court, part of a flood of last-ditch attempts at freedom under a Trump policy denying bond hearings in immigration court. Friends of their attorney drove them back to Minnesota at their own expense. Since then, the younger woman has been too afraid to leave the house.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe pastor who received a letter and went to the interviewSaw Ba Mya James, a 46-year-old ethnic Karen father of three who fled military persecution in Myanmar, arrived in St. Paul last year after obtaining refugee status with help from a local church.Despite a pending green card application, the Anglican pastor did not attend church for weeks after friends advised him to avoid going outside.“I was told to stay at home, so I listened, and I prayed to God with my family,” James said.James received a letter Feb. 2 ordering a “post-admissions refugee reverification” at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services St. Paul field office, according to a copy reviewed by The Associated Press.During an interview that lasted several hours, an officer pressed James with questions he said he already addressed extensively before being admitted to the U.S. The officer said the review was needed because an inexperienced employee handled James’ initial vetting.Within two weeks of the interview, James got another letter asking that he and his family provide fingerprints, which his attorney took as a positive sign.Still, James remains wary of being detained. He faithfully carries his church sponsors’ letter appealing for him and other immigrants to “be treated humanely as fellow image-bearers of God.”The Congolese refugee arrested arriving at workA Congolese woman settled in the Twin Cities area in November 2024 with refugee status, working in the hospitality business as the breadwinner for her husband and four children.She said an immigration officer approached her parked car when she arrived for work at 7 a.m. on Jan. 14 in St. Paul, saying he knew her name and that she was a refugee. After telling her to exit the vehicle to answer questions, he handcuffed her despite her efforts to show a work authorization document and identification.The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she fears reprisals, was flown to Houston to be questioned in detail about her experiences in the Congo, Uganda and the United States. She and other refugees refused to sign documents to be sent back to their home countries. She was released Jan. 18 without any ID documents to book a flight to Minneapolis. A manager at her company flew to Houston and drove her 17 hours back home.“If I told you I’m feeling OK, I’d be lying to you,” she said. ___Salomon reported from Miami.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                GISELA SALOMON\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Salomon is a Miami-based reporter who covers Latin America and immigration affairs for The Associated Press.Salomon es una periodista que desde Miami cubre asuntos latinoamericanos y de inmigracion.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto\n    \n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n            \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JACK BROOK\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Based in New Orleans, Brook covers Louisiana with a focus on state government, environmental issues and infrastructure.

        "title": "Scouting America will alter its policies to maintain support from the US military, Pentagon says",
        "text": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth speaks at Mar-a-Lag, Jan. 3, 2026, in Palm Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)2026-02-27T14:02:15Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — Scouting America will alter several policies at the urging of the Pentagon, including a requirement that members use “biological sex at birth and not gender identity,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Friday. Some of the changes mirror what the organization suggested to the Defense Department in January, which included discontinuing its Citizenship in Society merit badge and introducing a Military Service merit badge as well as waiving registration fees for the children of military personnel. Under Hegseth, the Pentagon has taken aim at the military’s partnership with Scouting America, decrying its historic rebrand in 2024 from the Boy Scouts and other changes in recent years that he sees as part of “woke culture” efforts that he wants to root out.Hegseth said in a video posted on X that the Pentagon will “vigorously review” the changes the organization has made in six months and will cease its support of Scouting America if it fails to comply. \n    \n        \n    \n\n“We hope that doesn’t happen, but it could,” Hegseth said. “Ideally I believe the Boy Scouts should go back to being the Boy Scouts as originally founded, a group that develops boys into men. Maybe someday.” \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nScouting America, which is based in Texas, didn’t immediately comment.The organization began allowing gay youth in 2013, ended a blanket ban on gay adult leaders in 2015 and announced in 2017 that it would accept transgender students. It began accepting girls as Cub Scouts as of 2018 and into the flagship Boy Scout program — renamed Scouts BSA — in 2019. As of May 2024, more than 6,000 girls had earned the coveted Eagle Scout rank.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe Pentagon said in a statement earlier this month that it was reviewing its relationship with Scouting America, claiming it had “lost its way” in many ways and calling the organization’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts “unacceptable.”\n    \n        \n    \n\n“Scouting America’s leadership has made decisions that run counter to the values of this administration,” the Feb. 6 statement said, ”including an embrace of DEl and other social justice, gender-fluid ideological stances.”The Pentagon previously said it and Scouting America were nearing an agreement to continue their partnership if the organization “rapidly implements the common-sense, core value reforms.” “Scouting America remains far from perfect, but they have firmly committed to a return to core principles,” the statement said. “Back to God and country—immediately!”The U.S. military and the Boy Scouts have had longtime ties, including the military providing logistical support for the National Boy Scout Jamboree since its inception in 1937. The military also has a long history of sponsoring Scout troops and activities on U.S. military bases and has maintained a strong relationship with the Eagle Scouts, whose members often enlist in the armed forces.In a statement last year, Scouting America raised concerns following a report from NPR that the Pentagon planned to cut support for Scouting programs on military bases as well as for the National Jamboree and would eliminate increases in pay grade for Eagle Scouts who enlist.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe Scouts told Hegseth in January that after hearing his suggestions, they had come up with a plan for him to review, which included discontinuing their Citizenship in Society merit badge and introducing a Military Service merit badge, waiving registration fees for military personnel and holding a ceremony to rededicate themselves to leadership, duty to God, duty to country and service, besides dissolving their DEI board committee.Founded in 1910, the Boy Scouts of America achieved a vaunted status in the U.S. over the decades, with pinewood derbies, the Scout Oath and Eagle Scouts becoming part of the lexicon.Lore has it that American businessman William Boyce was inspired to start the organization after he became lost in the fog in London and was guided to his destination by a youth who turned down a tip, telling Boyce that because he was a scout (they were formed in Britain in 1907) he couldn’t accept money for a good deed.\n    \n        \n    \n\nSince then, the organization has faced controversies and undergone significant changes.In 1990, the organization expelled an Eagle Scout who had become an assistant scoutmaster after discovering he was co-president of his university’s gay and lesbian organization. He sued in 1992 alleging discrimination and lost at the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that the Scouts could maintain membership and leadership criteria that excluded gay people.Conservative groups rallied around the Boy Scouts, but scores of institutions curtailed support as the ban continued. The ban ended in 2013. In 2015, the organization ended its blanket ban on gay adult leaders while allowing church-sponsored Scout units to maintain the exclusion for religious reasons.In 2017, the Boy Scouts announced that they would allow transgender children who identify as boys to enroll in their boys-only programs. That came after an 8-year-old was asked to leave his Scout troop in New Jersey after parents and leaders found out he was transgender.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe Boy Scouts also faced a flood of sexual abuse claims and sought bankruptcy protection in 2020, when it had been named in about 275 lawsuits and had told insurers it was aware of another 1,400 claims.In 2023, a judge upheld the $2.4 billion bankruptcy plan allowing the organization to keep operating while compensating more than 80,000 men who filed claims saying they were sexually abused while in scouting.Last year, Scouting America’s President and CEO Roger Krone acknowledged some backlash to the rebrand but described the overall response as a positive one that generated wider interest.“The fact that we were going with a more kind of gender-neutral name, a lot of people kind of wanted to know more about it,” Krone said.The organization said it saw a gain in membership of about 16,000 new scouts, less than 2% from the prior year. The organization said at the time that it had just over 1 million members.___Stengle reported from Dallas. Associated Press writer Konstantin Toropin contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Bill Clinton faces grilling from lawmakers over his connections to Jeffrey Epstein",
        "text": "Former President Bill Clinton speaks in the Cash Room of the Treasury Department during an event for the anniversary of the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund,, Nov. 21, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)2026-02-27T12:25:32Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Bill Clinton is testifying Friday before members of Congress investigating convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, answering for his connections to the disgraced financier from more than two decades ago.The closed-door deposition in Chappaqua, New York, will mark the first time a former president has been compelled to testify to Congress. It comes a day after Clinton’s wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, sat with lawmakers for her own deposition.Bill Clinton has also not been accused of any wrongdoing. Yet lawmakers are grappling with what accountability in the United States looks like at a time when men around the world have been toppled from their high-powered posts for maintaining their connections with Epstein after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges in Florida for soliciting prostitution from an underage girl.\n    \n        \n    \n\nHillary Clinton told lawmakers that she had no knowledge of how Epstein had sexually abused underage girls and had no recollection of even meeting him. But Bill Clinton will have to answer questions on a well-documented relationship with Epstein and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, even if it was from the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nHillary Clinton said Thursday that she expected her husband to testify that he had no knowledge of Epstein’s sexual abuse at the time they knew each other.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nRepublicans were relishing the opportunity to scrutinize the former Democratic president under oath.“The Clintons haven’t answered very many, if any, questions about their knowledge or involvement with Epstein and Maxwell,” Rep. James Comer, the Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee, said Thursday.“No one’s accusing, at this moment, the Clintons of any wrongdoing,” he added.\n    \n        \n    \n\nRepublicans finally get a chance to question Bill ClintonRepublicans have wanted to question Bill Clinton about Epstein for years, especially as conspiracy theories arose following Epstein’s 2019 suicide in a New York jail cell while he faced sex trafficking charges.Those calls reached a fever pitch late last year when several photos of the former president surfaced in the Department of Justice’s first release of case files on Epstein and Maxwell, a British socialite who was convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021 but maintains she’s innocent. Bill Clinton was photographed on a plane seated alongside a woman, whose face is redacted, with his arm around her. Another photo showed Clinton and Maxwell in a pool with another person whose face was redacted.Epstein also visited the White House several times during Clinton’s presidency, and the pair later made several international trips together for their humanitarian work.In the lead-up to the deposition, Bill Clinton has insisted he had limited knowledge about Epstein and was unaware of any sexual abuse he committed.“I think the chronology of the connection that he had with Epstein ended several years before anything about Epstein’s criminal activities came to light,” Hillary Clinton said at the conclusion of her deposition Thursday.Comer has pledged extensive questioning of the former president. He claimed that Hillary Clinton had repeatedly deferred questions about Epstein to her husband.\n    \n        \n    \n\nHas a precedent been set?Democrats, who have supported the push to get answers from Bill Clinton, are arguing that it sets a precedent that should also apply to President Donald Trump, a Republican who had his own relationship with Epstein. “We’re demanding immediately that we ask President Trump to testify in front of our committee and be deposed in front of Oversight Republicans and Democrats,” Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the committee, said Thursday.Comer has pushed back on that idea, saying that Trump has answered questions on Epstein from the press.Democrats are also calling for the resignation of Trump’s Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Lutnick was a longtime neighbor of Epstein in New York City but said on a podcast that he severed ties with Epstein following a 2005 tour of Epstein’s home that disturbed Lutnick and his wife.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe public release of case files showed that Lutnick actually had two engagements with Epstein years later. He attended a 2011 event at Epstein’s home, and in 2012 his family had lunch with Epstein on his private island.“He should be removed from office and at a minimum should come before the committee,” Garcia said of Lutnick.Comer on Thursday said that it was “very possible” that Lutnick would be called to testify.___Follow the AP’s coverage of Jeffrey Epstein at https://apnews.com/hub/jeffrey-epstein.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                STEPHEN GROVES\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Groves covers Congress for The Associated Press.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto",

        "text": "The Paramount Pictures water tower is seen in Los Angeles, Dec. 18, 2025, with the Hollywood sign in the distance. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File)2026-02-27T18:05:56Z\n                                        Two of Hollywood’s oldest studios may be consolidating into one. In a shocking twist after a monthslong bidding war, Paramount has emerged as the apparent victor in the fight to acquire Warner Bros.Netflix, who backed away from the deal Thursday, had hoped to win the movie studio and its vast film library. Paramount wants it all: Movies, cable networks and news.Almost 10 years ago, Hollywood’s big six became the big five when Disney bought most of 20th Century Fox. Now the big five looks like it’s destined to become the big four, including Universal and Sony, and the business of Hollywood moviemaking is one again in a time of profound transition.Here’s what we know, what we don’t and some burning questions.Why did Netflix bow out of the fight?Simply put, it was no longer “financially attractive,” the company said. In December, Netflix had reached a deal to acquire some of Warner Bros. Discovery’s assets: Their library, movie studio and HBO. Almost immediately Paramount, who months earlier had expressed interest in purchasing Warner Bros., initiated a hostile takeover bid for the whole company, which culminated in a $31 per share offer this week. Netflix, whose previous offer was $27.75 per share, declined to counter.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.′ iconic brands,” Netflix’s co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a joint statement. “But this transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.”\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nWarner had repeatedly backed the deal it struck with Netflix right up until Thursday evening, when its board continued to recommend Netflix even while calling Paramount’s bid, valued at about $111 billion including debt, “superior.”David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, said in a statement that they’re excited about, “the potential of a combined Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. Discovery and can’t wait to get started working together telling the stories that move the world.”\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nWhat are Paramount’s plans with Warner Bros.?Paramount Skydance chairman and CEO David Ellison has said that he would like to grow their combined slate to more than 30 movies a year, keeping Paramount and Warner Bros. as stand-alone operations.In documents filed to the Securities and Exchange Commission last month, Paramount said, “Our priority is to build a vibrant, healthy business and industry — one that supports Hollywood and creative, benefits consumers, encourages competition, and strengthens the overall job market.”They’ve also said they would look for ways to save some $6 billion through job cuts in “duplicative operations.”Executives at Paramount have argued that merging with Warner will allow it to compete with bigger rivals particularly in the streaming space and bring larger content libraries for its customers.\n    \n        \n    \n\nHow is Hollywood responding?Reminiscent of the hours after the Netflix deal was announced in December, there isn’t much public chatter from those inside the industry yet, but with several awards shows in the near future, including the Actor Awards Sunday, the relative silence is poised to break soon.The Paramount news broke as promotion is happening for Warner Bros’. latest movie, “The Bride!” Filmmaker Maggie Gyllenhaal told The Associated Press Friday that she didn’t feel prepared to speak to the deal specifically, but she did offer praise for the studio that supported her film.“I was reading tweets about it as I woke up this morning,” Gyllenhaal said. “I don’t have a position but I do feel really deeply supported by (Warner Bros. Motion Pictures Chairs) Pam (Abdy) and Mike (DeLuca) and I feel that they have been taking a slightly different route than most of the other people around them. They’ve been supporting films that are actually about something while at the same time, I think, encouraging the filmmakers who are making them to reach as big of an audience as possible. That combination is very specific and very precious.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe current state of Paramount movies vs. Warner Bros.Warner Bros., among the most filmmaker friendly studios operating, has had a banner year with major blockbusters and critical successes. This year they collected 30 Oscar nominations thanks to “Sinners,” “One Battle After Another” and “Weapons.” Paramount films received zero.In 2025, Warner Bros. movies (including “A Minecraft Movie,” “Superman” and “Sinners”) also accounted for 21% of the domestic box office; Paramount’s market share was only 6%, driven largely by “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning,” which didn’t even place in the top 10 (it was 11th).In November, Paramount pledged to up its 2026 theatrical output to at least 15 movies. Before the Skydance merger, the studio was more regularly releasing eight movies a year.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThough Paramount’s less than stellar 2025 has been attributed to the previous regime, Skydance has also not had the smoothest run at the box office, and its biggest hits have centered around Tom Cruise, with “Top Gun: Maverick,” its only billion-dollar film, and six “Mission: Impossibles.” It’s attempts to restart the “Terminator” franchise were less successful.While Warner Bros. has succeeded with a combination of original and franchise films, Paramount’s slate is decidedly more franchise heavy with intellectual property like “Transformers,” “Scream,” “Sonic the Hedgehog,” and “Paw Patrol” in their arsenal.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIs this a better outcome for movie theaters?Cinema United, the trade organization representing movie theaters, was vehemently opposed to a Netflix-owned Warner Bros. for fear of what it might mean for movie theaters. Exhibition and box office has not fully recovered since the pandemic — previously the annual domestic box office would regularly surpass $11 billion. Since 2020, it’s only exceeded $9 billion once.But consolidation is also a concern. Although Paramount has an established background in theatrical distribution, Cinema United worried about that outcome as well, which they explained in a statement to the Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing in early February.“If Paramount or another major studio ends up displacing Netflix as the buyer, our concerns are no less serious,” the trade organization wrote. “A combination of Paramount and Warner Bros., for instance, would consolidate as much as 40% of each year’s domestic box office in the hands of a single dominant studio.”In theory, a guaranteed 30 films a year would be a good thing for movie theaters, assuming they all go to theaters and it’s not a combination of theatrical and streaming titles as has happened with a Disney-owned 20th Century Studios. But some are skeptical that will pan out.Hollywood historian and author Mark Harris wrote on Bluesky that “the idea of a Paramount-WB merger producing 30-40 movies a year is an absurd fiction.” He predicted that first Warner Bros. will become the “classy” label within Paramount, “then it will become the specialty or streaming label. Then it will die.”Will HBO Max and Paramount+ combine?This remains unclear. It’s possible there will be a bundling situation as with Disney+ and Hulu.What will happen to the studio lots?With Paramount taking on billions in debt and equity for this deal to go through, many are wondering what will happen to the two California studio lots, especially in a moment where productions are rarer and rarer in California.The storied Paramount lot on Melrose in Los Angeles has 30 stages on 65 acres, hosting productions from “Sunset Boulevard” to “Forrest Gump.” Warner Bros.

        "title": "Rap's Underground Took Over Demna's Gucci Debut",
        "text": "If there's one thing about Demna: he's tapped in. For his big Gucci debut on the Milan Fashion Week runway, the Balenciaga-hailing Creative Director pulled out all of the stops – specifically from the underground hip-hop scene, that is.Gvasalia personally tapped a lineup of underground hip-hop artists to show face at Gucci's Fall/Winter 2026 show, sourcing a bunch of talent from the budding UK underground scene. Larger musicians – Kaytranada, Rico Nasty, and Steve Lacy included – were all in attendance to view the collection as per usual for any Demna affair, but it was the shocking slate of faces from the UK underground's new guard that stole the show.From runway cameos by fakemink and Nettspend to a Feng, Fimiguerrero, and Rico Ace-filled FROW, Demna has done it again; he has asserted his unmatched ability to bring relevant subcultures into his house's universe, using each collection as a physical vessel to envision a holistic representation of the modern zeitgeist.fakemink’s Phone Check Mid-WalkWe have to start with fakemink. Demna tapping the ever-so-elusive force from the underground to not only attend the show, but walk the show, is quite the feat. Mink shies away from the press, for the most part, and any information we get from him is typically funnelled through his social media accounts. That makes his phone-in-hand runway debut even more perfect. For the ascending rapper/producer's first-ever runway, mink wore a Gucci crossbody across his chest. About halfway down the runway, he grabbed his phone from the pocket of the bag, stopped walking, checked his phone, put it back in the bag, and continued his step down the runway. At one point, he also pulled the jacket over his head.Feng’s Front Row LinksFresh off the release of his big studio debut album, Weekend Rockstar, Feng sat front row for the Fall/Winter 2026 Gucci spectacle. Donning a clean all-denim fit, the U.K. musician also kept on all of his wristbands on his right arm to accessorize. He even fit in a link-up with Steve Lacy post-show.Nettspend Pushes Album Drop, Walks Runway InsteadA lot of people thought Nettspend was dropping his Early Life Crisis album lastnight. A lot. In the eleventh hour, the rapper decided to push the release to March 6, opening up his Early Life Crisis phone hotline for fans to air their grievances (presumably many over the last-minute delay) and, eight hours later, appearing on the Gucci runway. Nett made his runway debut last year in Paris, during Miu Miu's Fall/Winter 2026 show, but his cameo on Demna's inaugural Gucci runway – wearing a purple snakeskin shirt and silver snakeskin pants, nonetheless – felt like a match made in Milan.EsDeeKid's Seatmates: His Big Bag and Rico AceJust about 12 hours removed from his big Yeat collab cut, \"Made It On Our Own,\" EsDeeKid showed out in Demna's front row – and he came correct. The Scouse rapper sat with an oversized Gucci bag at his feet – like, really oversized. Dipped in a mostly black hue and hit with Gucci cues throughout, the bag complemented EsDee's typical face covering, and signature all-black look. Rico Ace sat next to him as well. FROW FimiguerreroFew looked flier than Fimiguerrero. The \"Vogue\" rapper served super sleek vibes in the front row in an all-black Gucci look, sunglasses included. Nate Sib Seated in the AudienceNate Sib is a name that you'll only start hearing more. This week, the budding 2hollis-esque, hyperpop-meets-rap artist was announced as the supporting act for Joji's imminent headlining tour. He was then spotted sat FROW a few days later for Demna's big debut. Lil Zino's Personal Demna InviteAt just 18 years old, Lil Zino is already making waves in the UK drill scene. What might be even more impressive, however, is he personally found himself on Demna's radar of invitees for the show. The designer reached out personally to Zino – who boasts 15k followers on his unverified Instagram account – to extend an invitation to the show. Now that's a proper co-sign.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

This week, the collaborators have unveiled the Athletic Formal Suit, which uses 100% cotton jersey, the same fabric used not only for t-shirts, but also for underwear. Among the most impressive qualities is that it's 100% machine-washable.However, this complete two-piece is not nearly as light as your undershirt, at 12 oz, which is nearly double the average tee. The heavyweight jersey lends itself well to the double-breasted jacket and pleated trousers, boasting a drawstring typical of joggers.

        "text": "SummaryHigh-profile debuts from Demna at Gucci, Maria Grazia Chiuri at Fendi, and Meryll Rogge at Marni redefine heritage through modern lenses.The 2026 Met Gala theme explores the intersection of couture and fine art.New collaborations and graduate showcases highlight technical outdoor gear and emerging visionary talentGucci Is Reborn in Demna's FW26 DebutDemna’s highly anticipated debut at Gucci marked a shift toward \"sensual minimalism,\" moving away from his signature oversized Balenciaga silhouettes. The collection prioritized \"wearability,\" blending Tom Ford-era sexiness with classic Florentine luxury. The runway featured a mix of icons like Kate Moss and emerging stars like Nettspend, set against a backdrop of Roman statues and flashing strobes. Men’s looks included laminated trousers and tight-fitting tees, while women’s attire featured mini-blazers and body-con dresses. Footwear reinterpreted traditional signatures into trend-forward shapes, such as sport loafers with sneaker overlays. Demna emphasized that his vision for the brand is a coexistence where heritage and fashion nourish one another, describing Gucci as a \"superbrand\" rooted in both pragmatic products and deep emotion.Fendi FW26 Welcomes Maria Grazia Chiuri Back as Creative DirectorMaria Grazia Chiuri returned to Fendi for her FW26 debut, shifting the house’s focus toward exquisite craftsmanship and Art Nouveau-inspired silhouettes. Moving away from loud monograms, Chiuri utilized \"applied materials\" and intricate embroideries to emphasize individuality. The collection leaned into a palette of black and white, featuring elongated lace slip-dresses and translucent gowns. Fendi’s fur heritage remained prominent with neon yellow-green coats and patchwork designs, while accessories like animal-print bags and oversized shades added a bold modern touch. References to the Viennese Secession movement paid homage to Karl Lagerfeld’s legacy, yet the inclusion of biker jackets and military-inspired garments kept the collection firmly in the present. Chiuri’s return reinstates Fendi as an arbiter of Roman elegance, favoring subtle luxury over overt branding.Marni's New Era Begins in Meryll Rogge's FW26 DebutMeryll Rogge, the first female creative director at Marni since its founder, used her FW26 debut to reconnect with the brand's quirky roots. Shifting away from the avant-garde maximalism of the previous era, Rogge introduced a \"pared-back eccentricity.\" The co-ed show opened with iconic pencil skirts covered in giant sequins—a nod to founder Consuelo Castiglioni. The collection featured chunky knits, multi-directional plaid pullovers, and cavalry-esque coats adorned with oversized silver buttons. Rogge’s vision focuses on \"quirky clothing for the everyday,\" balancing wearable basics with distinctive, playful details like fur trims and polka-dot tops. By reeling in experimental ambitions, Rogge aims to restore Marni’s reputation for sophisticated yet whimsical style, joining a growing wave of female designers leading major fashion houses.\"Fashion is Art\" Is the Dress Code of the 2026 Met GalaVogue has announced \"Fashion is Art\" as the official dress code for the 2026 Met Gala, scheduled for May 4. The theme aligns with the Costume Institute’s exhibition, \"Costume Art,\" which seeks to dismantle the hierarchy between fine art and the dressed body. The exhibition will feature nearly 400 objects spanning 5,000 years, housed in the new Condé Nast Galleries. An elite group of co-chairs—including Beyoncé, Nicole Kidman, and Venus Williams—will lead the event alongside creative director Anthony Vaccarello and Zoë Kravitz. Curator Andrew Bolton noted that fashion serves as the common thread connecting every curatorial department in the museum. The dress code challenges attendees to transcend traditional red-carpet attire by presenting garments as conceptual masterpieces worthy of a gallery setting.Official Look at the Upcoming Nike ACG x Cactus Plant Flea Market Collaboration SurfacesFollowing teasers featuring Travis Scott in Milan, official images of the Nike ACG x Cactus Plant Flea Market (CPFM) Spring/Summer 2026 capsule have been revealed. The collaboration focuses on highly functional, technical apparel designed for the elements. Key pieces include a weatherproof Anorak Jacket and a striking thermal-gradient Balaclava Hoodie. The collection also offers essential layering items such as a long-sleeve polo and crewneck sweatshirt. This partnership combines Nike ACG’s outdoor utility with CPFM’s signature playful and bold aesthetic. Spotted on cultural icons like Travis Scott and Yeat, the collection has already generated significant buzz. The full range is slated for a Spring 2026 release through both Nike and CPFM’s official channels, bridging the gap between high-performance gear and streetwear.Central Saint Martins 2026 M.A. Show Presents 23 of the Program's Emerging VisionariesCentral Saint Martins showcased the thesis collections of 23 M.A. students during London Fashion Week, offering a glimpse at the industry’s future leaders. This year’s show embraced a mood described as \"openly in flux,\" prioritizing hand-made craft and profound meaning over commercial polish. L'Oréal Professional Creative Award winners Maxina Brewer and Ennis Finnerty Mackay stood out for their artful and meaningful designs. The show continues the school’s legacy of producing legendary talents such as Alexander McQueen and Grace Wales Bonner.

Gucci only exists when both are in sync, when both nourish each other.\"Arguably, the most anticipated debut of the season, Demna was sure to make his debut runway presentation a hard hitter. In a dimly lit space, a stark white line of light illuminated the runway. The two sides of the audience were flanked by tall white statues of Roman gods illuminated by flashing strobes as techno and soft trap blared over the speakers.The atmosphere reflected Demna’s vision, which places fashion and heritage on equal footing — and so did the casting. Iconic supermodels like Kate Moss, Karlie Kloss, and Elsa Hosk walked alongside emerging talents like Fakemink and Nettspend. On the front row, Romeo Beckham and Donatella Versace sat side by side.

I shared fragments of this research through La Famiglia and Generation Gucci collections,\" Demna explained. Much like the Ford-inspired Pre-Fall 2026 collection, the sensual minimalism of FW26 was reminiscent of Tom Ford’s tenure at Gucci, which is widely seen as what made Gucci ‘sexy’ in the first place.Gone are Demna’s oversized Balenciaga silhouettes at Gucci; instead, men wore tight-fitting tees, slick laminated trousers, and leather jackets, while women wore a combination of mini-blazers, skinny jeans, knee-length skirts, and shimmering body-con dresses. Heritage was alive in Italian tailoring, Florentine florals, luxurious furs, and classic handbags, ranging from monogrammed duffles to miniature clutches. However, footwear reinterpreted traditional Gucci signatures, transferring them to trend-forward silhouettes. An ultra-slim sport loafer features sneaker-like overlays, while a distressed monogram upper accentuates laceless, flat-soled boots.

He refuses to call the brand a \"maison\" as couture was never their game. \"Gucci is a superbrand that is as much about pragmatic product as it is about emotion. Gucci is drama, passion, excess, contradiction, love and hate, triumph and collapse, pride and vulnerability, perseverance, chaos, genius.\"See the gallery above for a full look at Gucci FW26 and stay tuned to Hypebeast for the latest fashion industry news and updates.&nbsp;Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "title": "Street League Skateboarding Passes the Mic to Rayssa Leal and Chloe Covell",
        "text": "Street League Skateboarding officially steps away from the judges' booth to deliver an intimate conversation between two of the sport's biggest names: Rayssa Leal and Chloe Covell.In the high-stakes arena of professional street skating, few names command as much cultural gravity as Rayssa Leal and Chloe Covell. Hailing from Brazil, Leal — affectionately known as \"Fadinha\" — shattered the internet at age seven with a viral heelflip in a fairy tutu. Today, she backs up the early hype with a string of historic accolades: Olympic medals in Tokyo and Paris, multiple X Games golds, and the first-ever perfect \"9\" score for a woman in SLS history. Her influence has seamlessly bled into high fashion, cemented by her 2025 appointment as a Louis Vuitton brand ambassador.Matching that undeniable energy is Australia’s Chloe Covell. A technical prodigy credited with pushing switch skating to the forefront of women’s competition, Covell etched her name in the history books as the youngest X Games street gold medalist at just 13 years old. While the media often frames their frequent podium clashes—including Covell's massive hometown victory in Sydney—as a fierce rivalry, the reality is deeply rooted in mutual respect. Describing their bond as family, Covell frequently cites Leal as a core inspiration. To capture this dynamic, SLS handed the microphones directly to the teenagers, stripping away the competitor labels for an unfiltered discussion between the absolute best in the world.Rayssa Leal: What inspired you to get into this skate world?Chloe Covell: I was six years old at home watching the X Games on TV. It was 2016, and I saw Nyjah skating and just wanted to start.Rayssa Leal: How important is it to be with your family in competition and traveling?Chloe Covell: It’s really good. I like to have my dad as the coach because I can travel with the family. Sometimes my whole family comes on the trips, and it’s just good because we can do family things outside of skating, like being tourists.Rayssa Leal: Sydney 2023. You won. Tell us how you feel.Chloe Covell: That was crazy. I think it was my second solo win. I was just really happy that I could win in front of the home crowd. The home energy is just different; not having a long flight and just being home.Rayssa Leal: Who is your favorite skater in the whole world?Chloe Covell: It changes a lot. For men’s, I think Yuto Horigome is the GOAT. And for women’s—Rayssa! You are pushing the level of women’s skating.Rayssa Leal: What is your favorite country to travel to?Chloe Covell: First place is Brazil, for sure. Specifically Rio, because it has the beach and the contest there has such good vibes.Rayssa Leal: What is your favorite skate spot in the world?Chloe Covell: In Melbourne, Australia, there is a library with a bunch of good marble flat ledges. It’s really fun there.Rayssa Leal: What is your typical day like?Chloe Covell: I recently finished school, so now I usually just skate. I like to go for a surf every morning, go to the gym, and do recovery or physio.Rayssa Leal: What are your go-to Nike shoes to skate?Chloe Covell: My favorite shoes are GTis, for sure. I like dunks as well, but sometimes they are a little chunky. I like a slim shoe.Rayssa Leal: I really like Jordans, but I’ve never skated them. I tried to skate in a pair once when I forgot my shoes, but they were so slippery and chunky.Rayssa Leal: What do you like to listen to when you're skating?Chloe Covell: I don’t actually use AirPods because I’m scared it will mess with my head; I like to hear the \"pop\" of the board. But I always get them to play Sexyy Red over the speakers.Rayssa Leal: That’s my favorite! They played it for me in Japan last time and I was so happy.Rayssa Leal: How was your first Olympics?Chloe Covell: It was crazy. I didn’t stay in the village because I’m under 18—I stayed in a hotel, which was kind of sad. But I got to go there during the day for breakfast and saw so many famous people, like the tennis players.Rayssa Leal: Same for me.Chloe Covell: The skating was good and the park was fun, but I couldn’t pull it together. It was a good experience and I just have to learn for the next one.Rayssa Leal: What has been your worst injury?Chloe Covell: Last year at Super Crown, I broke my wrist. Or in Paris, I got stitches in my knee the day before the finals—that was bad because it was hard to move.Rayssa Leal: I've never broken anything, but I have \"little chips\" happen all the time.Rayssa Leal: If you were not a skater, what would you do?Chloe Covell: I think I would either be a soccer player or a surfer.Rayssa Leal: I really like animals... I would want to be a veterinary doctor.Moderator: What’s it like for you guys being friends and then competing with each other?Chloe Covell: We stay friends the whole time. The public might see us as rivals, but it’s not like that.Rayssa Leal: I feel motivated to do my best because I see her doing her best.Chloe Covell: All the girls just feed off each other’s energy.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "NASA&#x27;s Artemis II SLS (Space Launch System) moon rocket with the Orion spacecraft slowly rolls back towards the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center, Wednesday, Feb. 25, 2026, in Cape Canaveral, Fla. (AP Photo/John Raoux)2026-02-27T15:34:59Z\n                                        NASA said Friday it’s adding an extra moon mission by Artemis astronauts before attempting a high-risk lunar landing with a crew.The shakeup in the flight lineup came just two days after NASA’s new moon rocket returned to its hangar for more repairs and a safety panel warned the space agency to scale back its overly ambitious goals for humanity’s first lunar landing in more than half a century.Artemis II — a lunar fly-around by four astronauts — is off until at least April because of rocket problems.The follow-up mission — Artemis III — had been targeting a landing near the moon’s south pole by another pair of astronauts a year or two later. But with concern growing over the readiness of a lunar lander and moonwalking suits and long gaps between flights, NASA’s new administrator Jared Isaacman announced that mission would instead focus on launching a lunar lander into orbit around Earth for practice in 2027. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe new plan calls for a moon landing — potentially even two moon landings — by astronauts in 2028.Isaacman stressed that three years between flights is unacceptable and that he’d like to get it down to one year or even less. During NASA’s storied Apollo program, he said, astronauts’ first flight to the moon was followed by two more missions before Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel recommended this week that NASA revise its objectives for Artemis III “given the demanding mission goals.” It’s urgent the space agency do that, the panel said, if the United States hopes to safely return astronauts to the moon.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Our robots Lynx M20 help transport harvested crops in mountainous farmland—tackling the rural “last mile” logistics challenge.[ DEEP Robotics ]Once again, I would point out that now that we are reaching peak humanoid robots doing humanoid things, we are inevitably about to see humanoid robots doing non-humanoid things.[ Unitree ]In a study, a team of researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, the University of Michigan, and Cornell University show that groups of magnetic microrobots can generate fluidic forces strong enough to rotate objects in different directions without touching them. These microrobot swarms can turn gear systems, rotate objects much larger than the robots themselves, assemble structures on their own, and even pull in or push away many small objects.[ Science ] via [ Max Planck Institute ]Bipedal—or two-legged—autonomous robots can be quite agile. This makes them useful for performing tasks on uneven terrain, such as carrying equipment through outdoor environments or performing maintenance on an ocean-going ship. However, unstable or unpredictable conditions also increase the possibility of a robot wipeout. Until now, there’s been a significant lack of research into how a robot recovers when its direction shifts—for example, a robot losing balance when a truck makes a quick turn. The team aims to fix this research gap.[ Georgia Tech ]Robotics is about controlling energy, motion, and uncertainty in the real world.[ Carnegie Mellon University ]Delicious dinner cooked by our robot Robody. We’ve asked our investors to speak about why they’re along for the ride.[ Devanthro ]Tilt-rotor aerial robots enable omnidirectional maneuvering through thrust vectoring, but introduce significant control challenges due to the strong coupling between joint and rotor dynamics. This work investigates reinforcement learning for omnidirectional aerial motion control on over-actuated tiltable quadrotors that prioritizes robustness and agility.[ DRAGON Lab ]At the CMU Robotic Innovation Center’s 75,000-gallon water tank, members of the TartanAUV student group worked to further develop their autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) called Osprey. The team, which takes part in the annual RoboSub competition sponsored by the U.S. Office of Naval Research, is comprised primarily of undergraduate engineering and robotics students.[ Carnegie Mellon University ]Sure seems like the only person who would want a robot dog is a person who does not in fact want a dog.Compact size, industrial capability. Maximum torque of 90N·m, over 4 hours of no-load runtime, IP54 rainproof design. With a 15 kg payload, range exceeds 13 km. Open secondary development, empowering industry applications.[ Unitree ]If your robot video includes tasty baked goods it WILL be included in Video Friday.[ QB Robotics ]Astorino is a 6-axis educational robot created for practical and affordable teaching of robotics in schools and beyond. It has been created with 3D printing, so it allows for experimentation and the possible addition of parts. With its design and programming, it replicates the actions of industrial robots giving students the necessary skills for future work.[ Astorino by Kawasaki ]We need more autonomous driving datasets that accurately reflect how sucky driving can be a lot of the time.[ ASRL ]This Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute Seminar is by CMU’s own Victoria Webster-Wood, on “Robots as Models for Biology and Biology and Materials for Robots.”In the last century, it was common to envision robots as shining metal structures with rigid and halting motion. This imagery is in contrast to the fluid and organic motion of living organisms that inhabit our natural world. The adaptability, complex control, and advanced learning capabilities observed in animals are not yet fully understood, and therefore have not been fully captured by current robotic systems. Furthermore, many of the mechanical properties and control capabilities seen in animals have yet to be achieved in robotic platforms. In this talk, I will share an interdisciplinary research vision for robots as models for neuroscience and biology as materials for robots.[ CMU RI ]",

        "text": "Plano East varsity soccer player Aliya Jacob, left, controls the ball against Rock Hill&#x27;s Hanna Schinner during a soccer game, Jan. 30, 2026, in Murphy, Texas. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez)2026-02-27T14:04:14Z\n                                        HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Sofia Tepichin was about 30 minutes into her club soccer team practice in October when she spotted a fast-approaching defender. She tapped the ball away and hopped over the defender’s outstretched foot, came down awkwardly, and heard a “pop.”She immediately fell to the ground, pain shooting through her left knee and knew it wasn’t good. It was, she said, “heartbreaking.”“And I knew personally that I tore my ACL,” Tepichin said.Tepichin joined the growing ranks of female high school athletes tearing their anterior cruciate ligament, a devastating knee injury that researchers are pressing the sports world to take more seriously.Decades of research on prevention methods is available, but parents, researchers and trainers say that teams, coaches and leagues aren’t doing enough to protect the girls and educate parents.\n    \n        \n    \n\nHigh school female athletes are most vulnerableSports fans hear often about high-profile athletes like U.S. Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn tearing their ACLs, and many ACL injuries are chalked up to bad luck or a part of sports that will continue to happen at all competitive levels.Still, high school-age female athletes suffer these injuries at much higher rates than their male counterparts — up to eight times more likely, one study says — and adults, most often in noncontact situations in sports that require fast changes in direction, researchers say.Biomechanics researchers, trainers and physical therapists say there are pre-workout warm ups and strengthening routines — such as FIFA 11+ or PEP — that can at least reduce the risk of an injury that takes such a high physical and mental toll on young athletes. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nBut, they say, most coaches lack training or expert help, and high school girls compete in settings with far fewer resources than the professional and collegiate levels. As a result, risk-reduction routines are rarely included in day-to-day coaching curricula and practices.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“The real crime in this is that the data has been out there for 25 years,” said Holly Silvers-Granelli, a physical therapist and biomechanics researcher who advises athletes, professional teams and major sports leagues on injury prevention. “People are clamoring for answers, and the answers are largely there.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe trendline of ACL injuries isn’t entirely clear, but the National ACL Injury Coalition — formed by the Aspen Institute and the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York — said its analysis of data from high school athletic trainers showed that the average annual ACL injury rate for high school athletes grew almost 26% from 2007 to 2022. The rate for girls grew more than 32%, compared to 14.5% for boys, it said.\n    \n        \n    \n\nOn their own to recoverWhen they get injured, high school athletes and their parents often find themselves on their own to deal with it. ACL injuries can require surgery and a year of rehab, physical therapy and strength training, which insurance may not fully cover. Recovery changes their routine and identity: They miss out on the camaraderie of the team and stand on the sidelines, which can be as hard as the physical trauma, parents say.Many high school athletes who tear their ACL never perform again at the same level, if they even return to the sport, the National ACL Injury Coalition says. And once injured, they carry a heightened risk of another ACL injury and long-term complications like degenerative joint disease, researchers say.The coalition has urged the sports world to treat ACL injuries like brain injuries, now that professional and youth sports have tried to improve training, rules and equipment standards to prevent and detect concussions.Sophia Gerardi, a sophomore at Pennsylvania’s Apollo Ridge High School who tore her ACL during a basketball game in December, was told by her doctors that she’ll forever have to wear a knee brace to play sports. She had surgery in January, will miss volleyball season and hopes to be back for next winter’s basketball season.Like many girls who tore their ACL, she didn’t recall getting any ACL injury-prevention training.Surveys of coaches show that many don’t know about risk-reduction programs, aren’t trained to do them or aren’t encouraged to learn about them, said Vince Minjares, who leads the Aspen Institute’s ACL injury prevention project. Some coaches tell Minjares that it takes too much time.He hopes that’s changing.\n    \n        \n    \n\n‘What is the solution’This spring, the American Youth Soccer Organization — one of major national organizations in U.S. youth soccer — will roll out new age- and stage-based neuromuscular training programs aimed at preventing ACL injuries through warm-ups. Coaches will get a regimen of exercises in bite-sized chunks, with video instructions. The goal is to build good habits before preteens age into more physical and demanding competition.“My biggest shock was that this didn’t already exist,” said Scott Snyder, AYSO’s senior director of programs and education. “Everyone I talk to says, ‘Yeah, that makes perfect sense,’ but nobody’s done it yet.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nLast year, biomechanical researchers at the Scottish Rite for Children hospital in metropolitan Dallas began providing high school teams with resources typically only available or affordable at the professional and collegiate levels.They created pre-season injury-prevention trainings, tailored for female athletes, to improve strength and movement quality. At the start of the eight-week program, each athlete gets a free motion-capture 3D-level assessment to identify weaknesses in strength, movement or balance. Another assessment at the end determines if the program reduced risk. Future trainings could include nutrition and sleep, said Sophia Ulman, who directs the hospital’s Movement Science Laboratory.“My team and I got tired of studying ‘why, why, why’ when there’s so many different possibilities to answer that question. And we wanted to move into the ‘what is the solution,’” said Ulman. Other biomechanics labs in the U.S. are trying similar outreach, she said.One of the teams that participated was Plano East High School in Texas, where players — including Tepichin — had suffered a rash of ACL tears the past couple years.Cristy Cooley, Plano East’s coach, said that getting a hands-on demonstration from trained professionals in proper exercises and movement patterns makes a big difference.“It’s one thing talking about it,” Cooley said. “But it’s a totally different thing to show us.”‘Something’s got to change’Like other parents, Tiffany Jacob said she learned a lot about preventing ACL injuries that she wished she had known before her daughter — East Plano sophomore Aliya Jacob — tore her ACL last February. For instance, the surgeon told them three days a week of strength training is an absolute must for soccer players.“Something’s got to change,” Tiffany Jacob said. “Coaches, clubs, something. They have to do something to prevent this because it’s just such a horrible injury.”Aliya — who knows at least seven other female soccer players who tore an ACL, her mother said — is back playing for East Plano now. She endured twice-a-week physical therapy, the isolation of rehabilitation and, her mother said, “figuring out who you are when you’re not playing soccer.”Tepichin, a high school senior, recalls her surgeon telling her to take a couple days to get all her sadness and anger out — and then devote herself to her recovery.She’ll miss her last year of playing high school and club team soccer. Her next time on a field could be for Saint Vincent College in Pennsylvania, where she committed to the NCAA Division III team.Tepichin has seen a sports psychologist, gotten comfort from others who underwent the surgery — her sister, her father and her friend — and found a new routine after having been constantly busy with two soccer teams and a job.“There’s not a day that I go that I’m not working out or doing something,” she said, “or getting better for my health and my recovery.”___ Follow Marc Levy at http://twitter.com/timelywriter\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                MARC LEVY\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Levy covers politics and state government in Pennsylvania for The Associated Press.

Dr. Joy Gelbman, Associate Professor of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine as well as a board-certified cardiologist,  is well-versed in the unique challenges facing women when it comes to their cardiac health. She breaks down specific sex-specific risk factors, differing disease presentation and pathophysiology, as well as the experience disparities in treatments and outcomes.

A collaborative platform between Frieze and Art Production Fund (APF), the initiative makes up the fair’s public art program, a way for it to broaden its typical art reach with new commissions by Angeleno artists. This year’s showcase, titled Body &amp; Soul, gathers eight performances and installations, each exploring themes of existence, communion, embodiment and ritual.On a soccer field just beyond the fair, Amanda Ross-Ho debuts “Untitled Orbit (MANUAL MODE),“ a durational meditation on labor, where the artist rolls a 16-foot inflatable Earth during opening hours. Close by, Australian photographer Polly Borland lifts the veil on “BOD,“ her largest sculpture to date. Cast in aluminum, the seven-foot-tall figure expands her signature soft, wrapped forms into a simultaneously vulnerable and imposing presence.&nbsp;&nbsp;View this post on Instagram&nbsp;A post shared by Frieze (@friezeofficial)Woodworker Shana Hoehn embeds  floating figures into “Deadfall”, her first large-scale public sculpture carved from a ficus sourced through the city’s urban forest program, evoking decay and transformation. Kohshin Finley, in a fitting next move after his recent Jeffrey Deitch solo, presents “The Piano Player,” a body of large-scale stoneware vessels displayed in shadow-box shelving, while Dan John Anderson exhibits two glass and bronze sculptures, “Threshold” and “Terra Seer,” which tap into the totemic, light and shadow.Beyond the fairgrounds, Kelly Wall reanimates a dormant Westwood Village newsstand with “Everything Must Go,” where glass “magazine” covers fill the structure and gradually disappear over the course of the week. Finally, Cosmas &amp; Damian Brown mounts interactive fountain works that invite touch, as smoke and soundscapes shift through rearrangeable metal vessels.Body &amp; Soul is now on view until March 1. Alongside the presentation, Brown will lead a special youth workshop on February 28, as part of APF’s Art Sundae program, leading up to a collaborative public art installation between the artists and children.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

In humans, studies have shown that reduced calorie intake improves health in ways that are likely result in an extension of life span. Short-lived species exhibit a greater relative extension of life as a result of calorie restriction than is the case for long-lived species. In mice, calorie restriction can produce as much as a 40% extension of life span. In humans, a few years of additional life seems the likely effect size, although the only thing we can say in certainty given the data to hand is that the benefit cannot be much larger than this.

In general, the research community is motivated to better understand the biochemistry of senescence in order to improve efforts to either selectively destroy senescent cells or alter their behavior to reduce the harmful pro-inflammatory signaling that they produce.

Our investigation reveals the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway as an orchestrator of immune-mediated retinal degeneration, exhibiting biphasic, stage-dependent functionality-providing cytoprotection in healthy tissue but driving pathogenic inflammation during early AMD progression. Through immunohistochemical analysis of human eyes, we demonstrate stage-dependent cytoplasmic STING upregulation with parallel IFN-β activation. Using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells-retinal pigment epithelium (iPSC-RPE) from AMD siblings, we discovered polarized cytokine secretion: apical IFN-β triggers photoreceptor apoptosis in human retinal organoids, while basal IL-17A compromises choroidal neovascularization. The Cryba1 conditional knockout (cKO) AMD-like mouse model confirms STING-driven IL-17A expression, while Il17a knock-in mice substantiate vascular alterations. STING activation establishes a pathogenic feed-forward loop between interferons and IL-17A. Single-cell transcriptomics following AAV2-mediated IFN-β overexpression reveals metabolic and phototransduction dysregulation. Both pharmacological STING inhibition with SN-011 and genetic approaches demonstrate therapeutic rescue. Cryba1/Sting double heterozygous (dhet) mice maintain homeostatic gene expression preserving retinal architecture and function. These findings establish STING as the master regulator simultaneously controlling multiple AMD pathologies through spatially organized inflammation, transforming from protective surveillance to pathogenic driver, and identifying a unified therapeutic target with demonstrated functional rescue across multiple experimental paradigms.\n                \n                Longevity Relevance Analysis\n                The paper claims that STING activation drives pathogenic inflammation in age-related macular degeneration, establishing it as a master regulator of multiple AMD pathologies. This research is relevant as it addresses the underlying mechanisms of an age-related disease and proposes a unified therapeutic target, contributing to the understanding of aging-related degeneration.\n                \n                Read the full paper",

A study published by a research team from the University of Naples Federico II, Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, and several international partner institutions in the journal Global Ecology and Conservation shows that this fine-scale temporal partitioning helps the bats avoid competition and may be crucial for surviving at the cold edge of a climate-driven range expansion.",

        "text": "Every year, over 100 billion nitrile rubber gloves are produced. They are made from synthetic polymers—a material chemically related to plastic and derived from crude oil. The vast majority is used in the health care sector, and most are discarded after single use. This creates a massive amount of material waste globally. However, Simon Kildahl, a postdoc at the Department of Chemistry at Aarhus University, has moved a step closer to a way of recycling these gloves. In a new study published in the journal Chem, he and his colleagues demonstrate how they can transform waste rubber into a CO2 adsorbent in the laboratory. The potential, he explains, is significant.",

Held on the first weekend of Ramadan, it marked the first time an event of this kind has been hosted in the region, turning sundown celebrations into a peaceful moment of reconnecting with nature.Helping to illuminate the way, Columbia Hike Society installed solar-powered lights across several paths to make hiking more accessible in the low-light season. In addition to this, attendees were equipped with the sportswear brand’s signature Tellurix Titanium Outdry shoes and Omni-Heat jacket for extra protection against the elements, reaffirming how the sport can be enjoyed all-year round, not just a summer activity.Coming off the success of the initial event, the platform now looks ahead to hosting more nighttime hikes in the region. It also hopes local hikers will make use of the permanently installed infrastructure for their own escapes in the mountains. Be sure to visit Columbia Sportswear’s Instagram page to get the latest on its upcoming events.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",
