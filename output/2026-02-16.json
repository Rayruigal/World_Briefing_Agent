        "title": "No clear path to ending the partial government shutdown as lawmakers dig in over DHS oversight",
        "text": "A sign for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is seen on the Saint Elizabeth campus in Washington, Friday, Feb. 13, 2026. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)2026-02-15T18:49:03Z\n                                        WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Lawmakers and the White House offered no signs of compromise Sunday in their battle over oversight of federal immigration officers that has led to a pause in funding for the Department of Homeland Security.A partial government shutdown began Saturday after congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump’s team failed to reach a deal on legislation to fund the department through September. Democrats are demanding changes to how immigration operations are conducted after the fatal shootings of U.S. citizens Alex Pretti and Renee Good by federal officers in Minneapolis last month.Congress is on recess until Feb. 23, and both sides appear dug into their positions. The impasse affects agencies such as the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Coast Guard, the Secret Service, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe work at ICE and CBP goes on unabated because Trump’s tax and spending cut law from 2025 provided billions more to those agencies that can be tapped for deportation operations. About 90% of DHS employees were to continue working during the shutdown, but do so without pay — and missed paychecks could mean financial hardships. Last year there was a record 43-day government shutdown.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nWhite House border czar Tom Homan said the administration was unwilling to agree to Democrats’ demands that federal officers clearly identify themselves, remove masks during operations and display unique ID numbers.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“I don’t like the masks, either,” Homan said, But, he said, “These men and women have to protect themselves.”Democrats also want to require immigration agents to wear body cameras and mandate judicial warrants for arrests on private property.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Democrats are only asking for federal agents to abide by rules followed by law enforcement agencies around the country.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“And the question that Americans are asking is, ‘Why aren’t Republicans going along with these commonsense proposals?’” Schumer said. “They’re not crazy. They’re not way out. They’re what every police department in America does.”Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said he could back Democrats calls to equip immigration officers with body cameras and would support efforts to bolster training. But he balked at their demands that federal officer remove masks and clearly identify themselves, noting some officers taking part in immigration enforcement operations have faced doxing and other harassment.“What are you going to do, expose their faces so you can intimidate their families?” Mullins said. “What we want is ICE to be able to do their job. And we would love for local law enforcement and for states to cooperate with us.”Republican Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama, a Trump ally who had pushed for a two-week extension of DHS funding while negotiations continued, said it was “shortsighted of Democrats to walk away” from talks. Trump made enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign for the White House and he promised to be aggressive in detaining and deporting people living in the United States without legal permission.\n    \n        \n    \n\nDHS reports it has deported more than 675,000 migrants since Trump’s return to office last year and claims some 2.2 million others have “self-deported” as the Republican president has made his immigration crackdown a priority.“President Trump is not going to back away from the mission, the mission that American people said they wanted him to complete, and that is securing our border and making sure that we actually do interior enforcement,” Britt said.Homan was on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Schumer and Mullin appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union” and Britt was interviewed on “Fox News Sunday.”\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                AAMER MADHANI\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Madhani covers the White House for The Associated Press.

        "title": "Should people with autism and very high needs have a separate diagnosis? Takeaways from AP’s report",
        "text": "Ronan Murphy snuggles with his mom, Andrea, while looking at the snow falling outside his home while brother, Connor sits nearby in Ayer, Mass., on Saturday, Jan. 17, 2026. (AP Photo/Shelby Lum)2026-02-15T12:37:39Z\n                                        As the definition of autism has widened, there’s been a growing push to create a new diagnosis, called profound autism, for those who need constant and lifelong care.The reason? To ensure that they get the support and services they need.Judith Ursitti, president of the Profound Autism Alliance, said people in this category now lack appropriate treatments, support and enough providers trained to handle their level of care. And the vast majority of clinical research doesn’t include them.“If you don’t have research, you won’t have treatments. You won’t have achievable services and supports,” said Ursitti, whose adult son has profound autism. “There are people across the spectrum who have high support needs that are intermittent. The difference with our population is they’re constant.”Autism rates have been rising for decades, and two of the main reasons for the increase have, in a strange twist, taken some of the focus off of helping people with round-the-clock needs. The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is now very broad, including many people with low support needs. Also, better awareness of the condition has helped many more children get diagnosed than in the past — and most of those cases are relatively mild. \n    \n        \n    \n\nAt the same time, the Trump Administration is promoting unproven and debunked claims about what causes autism, which experts say muddles efforts to understand the condition and fuels misinformation that threatens public health, even as officials funnel more money into research.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nOverall in the U.S., an estimated 1 in 31 children has autism spectrum disorder.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nResearchers estimate around a quarter have “profound autism,” a term introduced in 2021 by a group of experts, the Lancet Commission. It describes people who need constant care for life, have a certain level of intellectual disability and are nonverbal or minimally verbal.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIn the past, these people may have been diagnosed with autistic disorder – one of five subtypes, along with Asperger’s, of a diagnosis called pervasive developmental disorders. But in 2013, the American Psychiatric Association removed that diagnosis and created autism spectrum disorder.Some in the autism community worry that creating a separate diagnosis of profound autism would reduce attention on the broader spectrum and the individual needs of everyone on it.Dena Gassner, an autistic senior research scientist at Drexel University and mother of an autistic adult with moderate support needs, said she struggles with the idea of assigning someone the label of profound autism. She said it could be stigmatizing.She said there’s nothing wrong with being autistic; the problem lies in “the massive lack of supports and services” in our society. “We need to come together in a unified voice to talk about services for the entirety of the spectrum.”Andy Shih, chief science officer for Autism Speaks, said no matter where people fall on the debate about profound autism, “there’s absolutely no doubt that we need to elevate awareness about the needs of this group.”___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)2026-02-15T05:01:30Z\n                                        Ethan Hawke,Rose Byrne and Keke Palmer are just a few of the actors up for prizes at the Film Independent Spirit Awards on Sunday in Los Angeles. Comedian and “Saturday Night Live” veteran Ego Nwodim is hosting the celebration of independent film and television, which is being livestreamed on YouTube.Top nominees going into the 41st edition of the show include Ira Sachs’ “Peter Hujar’s Day,” which recreates an interview with the 1970s photographer, played by Ben Whishaw; Clint Bentley’s lyrical Denis Johnson adaptation “Train Dreams,” with Joel Edgerton; and Eva Victor’s “Sorry, Baby,” about life after an assault.The show, which serves as a fundraiser for Film Independent’s year-round programs, is being held at the Hollywood Palladium for the first time, as its longtime beachside perch in Santa Monica undergoes renovations.The awards sometimes overlap significantly with major Oscar contenders and winners, as it did with “Anora,” and “Everything Everywhere All At Once,” and sometimes not. Organizers limit eligibility to productions with budgets less than $30 million, meaning more expensive films like “One Battle After Another” are not in the running.\n    \n        \n    \n\nByrne is one of the few actors nominated for both a Spirit Award and an Oscar, for her performance as a mother on the edge in Mary Bronstein’s “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You.” In the lead performance category, she’s up against the likes of Edgerton (“Train Dreams”), Dylan O’Brien (“Twinless”), Palmer (“One of Them Days”), Tessa Thompson (“Hedda”) and Whishaw. The organization switched to gender-neutral acting categories in 2022.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nSupporting performance nominees include Naomi Ackie (“Sorry, Baby”), Zoey Deutch (“Nouvelle Vague”), Kirsten Dunst (“Roofman”), Nina Hoss (“Hedda”) and Archie Madekwe (“Lurker”).\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nFilms nominated in the international category include “Sirāt,”“The Secret Agent” and “On Becoming a Guinea Fowl.” “Come See Me in the Good Light,” “My Undesirable Friends: Part I — Last Air in Moscow” and “The Perfect Neighbor” are also up for the documentary prize.Hawke, who is nominated for an Oscar for “Blue Moon,” is up for a Spirit Award for his leading performance in the television series “The Lowdown,” where other nominees include Seth Rogen for “The Studio,” Stephen Graham for “Adolescence” and Noah Wyle for “The Pitt.”\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                LINDSEY BAHR\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Bahr has been a film writer and critic for The Associated Press since 2014.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        instagram\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto",

        "text": "This image released by Warner Bros. Pictures shows Margot Robbie, right, and Jacob Elordi in a scene from &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot; (Warner Bros. Pictures via AP)2026-02-15T16:36:16Z\n                                        Emerald Fennell’s bold reimagining of “Wuthering Heights” brought crowds of women to movie theaters this weekend. The Warner Bros. release topped the box office charts and nabbed the title for the year’s biggest opening with $34.8 million in ticket sales in its first three days in North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday. According to PostTrak polling, an estimated 76% of those ticket buyers were women. By the end of Monday’s Presidents Day holiday, the total could rise to $40 million from its 3,682 locations. The romantic drama starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi as the star-crossed Catherine and Heathcliff, won out over the weekend’s other newcomers, including the animated “GOAT” and the heist thriller “Crime 101.” Its biggest day was Saturday’s Valentine’s Day holiday, where it earned $14 million. “Wuthering Heights” is also performing even better internationally, where it’s expecting to rake in an additional $42 million from 76 territories. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe Warner Bros./MRC production cost a reported $80 million to produce, not accounting for the millions spent on marketing and promotion. If the four-day totals match the estimates, that makes for a strong $82 million global debut. And the film still has several big openings on the horizon, in Japan and Vietnam on Feb. 27, and in China on March 13.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe success comes while the future of Warner Bros. hangs in the balance, as Paramount continues to sweeten its hostile takeover bid in hopes of winning out over Netflix. “Wuthering Heights” is the studio’s ninth No. 1 opening in a row.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nFennell’s version of “Wuthering Heights,” which takes many liberties with Emily Brontë’s novel, largely divided critics. It’s currently sitting at a mixed 63% on Rotten Tomatoes. While that didn’t dissuade audiences from buying tickets, only 51% of the opening weekend audience said that they would “definitely recommend” the film to friends. Moviegoers also gave it a less-than-stellar B CinemaScore.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe mid-February weekend has hosted big superhero movies on occasion, including “Black Panther” and “Deadpool,” but a more relevant comparison is “Fifty Shades of Grey” and its two sequels. The first movie opened to over $85 million, the third to $38.6 million.“This was a solid if not record-breaking Presidents Day/Valentines weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, who heads marketplace trends for Comscore. “But that was to be expected without an MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) film.”“GOAT,” an animated Sony release produced by basketball star Stephen Curry, landed in second place with an estimated $26 million from 3,863 locations. It’s projected to bring in another $6 million on Monday, which would bring its four day total to $32 million — the biggest animated debut since “Elemental” in 2023. It also pulled in $15.6 million internationally, bringing its global total to $47.6 million. The family-friendly film was the only new opener of the weekend to get an A CinemaScore. Sony Pictures Animation was also behind “KPop Demon Hunters.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nIn third place, “Crime 101” made an estimated $15.1 million in its first three days. Amazon MGM Studios opened the Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo led Los Angeles-set thriller in 3,161 theaters. It’s expected to pull in about $17.8 million by the end of Monday, but the movie has a long way to go to even hit its production budget, which reportedly exceeded $90 million. Audiences, who were 56% men, also gave “Crime 101” a B CinemaScore.“Send Help” and “Solo Mio” rounded out the top five with $9 million and $6.4 million, respectively. Further down the charts, at No. 7, was Briarcliff Entertainment’s sci-fi comedy “Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die,” starring Sam Rockwell and Haley Lu Richardson. It made an estimated $3.6 million from 1,610 locations.The Walt Disney Studios also celebrated a milestone this weekend, becoming the first studio to cross $1 billion at the global box office in 2026, driven almost entirely by “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” but also helped by the continued success of “Zootopia 2,” which remains in the top 10 after twelve weekends in theaters. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe weekend is down significantly from the same weekend last year, when “Captain America: Brave New World” opened, but the pace is starting to pick up and theaters have “Scream 7” and “Project Hail Mary” on the horizon.“It’s been a rather slow first quarter,” Dergarabedian said. “But this could ignite a spark at the box office.”Top 10 movies by domestic box officeWith final domestic figures being released Tuesday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:1. “Wuthering Heights,” $34.8 million.2. “GOAT,” $26 million.3. “Crime 101,” $15.1 million.4. “Send Help,” $9 million.5. “Solo Mio,” $6.4 million.6. “Zootopia 2,” $3.8 million.7. “Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die,” $3.6 million.8. “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” $3.3 million.9. “Iron Lung,” $3.1 million.10. “Dracula,” $3 million.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                LINDSEY BAHR\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Bahr has been a film writer and critic for The Associated Press since 2014.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        instagram\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto",

        "title": "Rare FC Barcelona x Nike Kobe 6 Sample Has Surfaced",
        "text": "SummaryA rare Nike Kobe 6 sample featuring FC Barcelona’s home colors has surfaced onlineThe design traces back to a 2011 release that celebrated Kobe Bryant's passion for soccer, developed during his childhood in ItalyThe sample features a Royal Blue polyurethane upper, Deep Garnet midsole, and Bright Gold Swoosh, with the club crest on the inner tongueThe connection between Kobe Bryant and the beautiful game continues to yield hidden gems from the Nike archives. A rare \"FC Barcelona\" Nike Kobe 6 sample has officially surfaced, offering a fresh look at a design originally conceived to honor the Black Mamba’s deep-rooted passion for soccer. The prototype, which traces its lineage back to a limited 2011 release, captures the essence of the Spanish powerhouse club with a faithful execution of their iconic kit colors.Dressed in FC Barcelona's traditional home palette, the sample is dominated by a textured Royal Blue polyurethane upper that mimics the snake-scale aesthetic of the Kobe 6 line. A Bright Gold Swoosh cuts across the side panel, providing a sharp contrast, while Deep Garnet wraps the midsole and heel structure to complete the \"Blaugrana\" theme. A subtle yet significant detail is the inclusion of the FC Barcelona club crest on the inner tongue, solidifying the partnership between the basketball legend and the football giants.Under the hood, the model retains the silhouette’s classic performance DNA, featuring Phylon cushioning paired with Zoom Air units in the heel and forefoot. The design serves as a reminder of Bryant's upbringing in Italy, where his love for soccer flourished alongside his basketball development.While fans have long clamored for a Protro release of this specific colorway, there is currently no official confirmation that the Kobe 6 \"FC Barcelona\" will hit retail shelves. However, the partnership remains active; following the release of a Kobe 11 Protro in 2016 and a Kobe 6 Protro \"Mambacita\" tribute, reports indicate that an \"FC Barcelona\" Nike Kobe 8 Protro is currently on the calendar for a Fall 2026 release.&nbsp;Näytä tämä julkaisu Instagramissa&nbsp;Henkilön Yyt_Snkrs (@yyt_snkrs) jakama julkaisuClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "SummaryNEIGHBORHOOD and Team Ikuzawa have announced the \"Dirt Track Storm\" collaborative capsule, inspired by vintage dirt bike culture and the racing heritage of Tetsu Ikuzawa.Key pieces include checker-pattern racing jackets, \"sauvage\" treated crewnecks, and accessoriesThe campaign was shot at El Mirage Dry Lake by photographer and flat-track racer Dimitri Coste, and launches globally on February 21, 2026NEIGHBORHOOD and Team Ikuzawa are hitting the dirt. Born from a longstanding friendship between Sin Takizawa and Mai Ikuzawa, the two Japanese heavyweights have unveiled \"Dirt Track Storm,\" a new capsule collection that bridges the gap between rigorous streetwear precision and authentic motorsport heritage. The project acts as a cultural intersection, fusing Takizawa's design language with the \"freedom, speed, and personal history\" of the Ikuzawa legacy.The collection is anchored by utilitarian construction and the aesthetic of vintage flat track racing. Leading the lineup are two iconic racing jackets, including a standout version rendered in an original checker pattern. The apparel range is rounded out by a crewneck finished with a \"sauvage\" treatment for a worn-in feel, alongside long and short sleeve T-shirts. Accessories include a Trunk bag and a bandana, each piece designed to unify the branding of both houses into a single statement of \"uncompromising design.\"The narrative behind the capsule runs deep, paying tribute to the life of Team Ikuzawa founder, Tetsu Ikuzawa. A pioneer on two wheels, Tetsu was the first-ever flat track racer from Japan to compete internationally, tearing up circuits from Australia to the legendary Ascot track in Gardena, California. His history—which includes victories at the Suzuka 8 Hours and participation in the Isle of Man TT—serves as the spiritual backbone of the collection, blending high-performance pedigree with the style of 1970s desert riding.To capture this spirit, the brands tapped close friend and French photographer Dimitri Coste. A flat-track legend in his own right, Coste shot the campaign as a series of self-portraits at the El Mirage Dry Lake in California. The imagery strips the concept back to \"motion, dust, and solitude,\" depicting the pure, meditative pleasure of riding alone in the vast American desert.The NEIGHBORHOOD x Team Ikuzawa \"Dirt Track Storm\" collection launches globally on February 21, 2026. It will be available via NEIGHBORHOOD in-stores (Japan), the online store, and the Team Ikuzawa online shop (which ships worldwide).Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "title": "Closer Look: Collina Strada FW26 Footwear",
        "text": "Hillary Taymour's creative vision continues to evolve alongside the current state of the world, the designer's Collina Strada-verse acting as its own safe space amidst all the harsh realities that remain out of our control. Taymour has built an immersive world where rules are meant to be broken, and norms encouraged to be challenged, crafting a colorful, chaotically cohesive universe where everyone who enters is free to be themselves. On the heels of the Spring/Summer 2026 \"Shade\" showcase – which commented on the duality of light and dark – comes Fall/Winter 2026's \"The World Is A Vampire.\"\"As the metaphorical and literal weather worsens outside, we withdraw into self-made sanctuaries. After all, a vampire cannot enter unless invited in,\" begin the show notes, contextualizing the new Collina chapter we're witnessing.\"We bundle up inside, draw the curtains to shut out the light and the noise, and dream of better worlds outside our windows. The snow falls delicately with intention, grace, and poise inside our perfect satin-lined snow globes. No crusty banks of slippery, nasty ICE on our streets. We wrap ourselves in translucent layers, and organza collars rise at the neck in protection. We start to fade from the mirror, because we don't reflect this brutal world; we're only seen on our own terms. The world is trying to turn us, but we're hanging on to humanity, even as our fangs sharpen with disillusionment. Despite all our rage, we are still just bats in a cage, but at least our fur is plant-based, and our cage is Collina.\"Complementing the new collection – which leaned into a darker color palette than typical for Taymour – came vampy beauty looks and an even vampier, yet still-classic Collina Strada soundtrack.  However, the Fall/Winter 2026 footwear collaborations proved a particular high point of the showcase. KEEN was the official footwear partner of the show, presenting reworked iterations of two of its classic silhouettes: the Targhee EXP Collina Strada Boot and the Jasper Rocks Collina Strada Sneaker. Converse also contributed a pair of low-top Chuck Taylors, reimagined through the Collina lens.Take a closer look at this season's footwear in the gallery above, and read the full interview with Hillary Taymour below.Let's start with the name of the collection: \"The World Is a Vampire.\" Why did you choose that name? Everything feels really soul-sucking right now. There's a lot of energy being drained out of us. We need to figure out how to protect ourselves because the vampire can't come in unless you let it inside.How do you use Collina Strada as an outlet in this chaotic world in which we often feel as though we have no control?I just try to make a safe space for everyone to express themselves, and right now, I just want to be a strong woman-owned business that can fight for our own rights, be stable, and support our community. I try to be the best version of myself to support myself, my team, and everyone.One of my favorite parts of your show every season is the soundtrack. Could you share more about how you curated this year's? I worked with TT.BRITT on the soundtrack. He was amazing. We worked for a while to get this perfect vampy energy, but it still feels very modern and fun. So many layers.The footwear was incredible – could you tell me more about the collaborations? We have a collaboration coming out with KEEN in October, which I'm super excited about. We did two silhouettes with them. Then there's also a Converse collaboration in there, too.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

For the Spring/Summer 2026 season, the brand is revisiting its most culturally significant silhouettes, preserving the utilitarian DNA that defined them while injecting fresh energy through color and structural adaptation. The new campaign highlights how these pieces, from the Detroit Jacket to the Double Knee Pant, have transcended their manual labor origins to become permanent fixtures in the collective memory of style.The core of the collection remains anchored in the brand's \"solid forms.\" The Michigan Coat retains its signature four-pocket configuration, while the Detroit Jacket keeps its recognizable waist-length cut and zipped chest pocket. The Double Knee Pant also stays true to spec with its double-layer knees and hammer loop. However, for SS26, these staples move beyond the traditional Hamilton Brown, black, and navy (though those core shades remain), appearing in new seasonal hues of dusky turquoise, green, and mauve.Beyond the color updates, Carhartt WIP is using its archive as a launchpad for new design explorations. The Women’s Maeve Skirt reinterprets the Double Knee Pant through paneling and metal rivets, offering a rugged yet contemporary alternative. The Clapton Jacket riffs on the Michigan Coat but swaps the canvas for nylon and adds a sleeve pocket for a modern utility look. Additionally, the Women’s Clark Jacket presents a subtly oversized take on the Detroit Jacket, synthesizing the boxy workwear original with current trend fits.The Carhartt WIP Spring/Summer 2026 Icons collection is available now and can find the release at select global retailers, Carhartt WIP flagship stores, the brand's official website.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "The Pentagon, the headquarters for the U.S. Department of Defense, is seen from the air, Sept. 20, 2025, in Arlington, Va. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, FIle)2026-02-15T13:56:40Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. military forces boarded another sanctioned tanker in the Indian Ocean after tracking the vessel from the Caribbean Sea in an effort to target illicit oil connected to Venezuela, the Pentagon said Sunday. Venezuela had faced U.S. sanctions on its oil for several years, relying on a shadow fleet of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains. President Donald Trump ordered a quarantine of sanctioned tankers in December to pressure then-President Nicolás Maduro before Maduro was apprehended in January during an American military operation. Several tankers fled the Venezuelan coast in the wake of the raid, including the ship that was boarded in the Indian Ocean overnight. The Defense Department said in a post on X that U.S. forces boarded the Veronica III, conducting “a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding.” \n    \n        \n    \n\n“The vessel tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine — hoping to slip away,” the Pentagon said. “We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down.” Video posted by the Pentagon shows U.S. troops boarding the tanker.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe Veronica III is a Panamanian-flagged vessel under U.S. sanctions related to Iran, according to the website of the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. The Panama Maritime Authority said Sunday in a brief statement that the ship was no longer registered there and had been canceled in December 2024. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe Veronica III left Venezuela on Jan. 3, the same day as Maduro’s capture, with nearly 2 million barrels of crude and fuel oil, TankerTrackers.com posted Sunday on X.“Since 2023, she’s been involved with Russian, Iranian and Venezuelan oil,” the organization said.Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com, told The Associated Press in January that his organization used satellite imagery and surface-level photos to document that at least 16 tankers left the Venezuelan coast in contravention of the quarantine. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe Trump administration has been seizing tankers as part of its broader efforts to take control of the Venezuela’s oil. The Pentagon did not say in the post whether the Veronica III was formally seized and placed under U.S. control, and later told the AP in an email that it had no additional information to provide beyond that post.Last week, the U.S. military boarded a different tanker in the Indian Ocean, the Aquila II. The ship was being held while its ultimate fate was decided by the United States, according to a defense official who spoke last week on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing decision-making.—-Associated Press writers Konstantin Toropin in Washington and Alma Solís in Panama City contributed to this report. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n                    \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n                    \n    获取更多RSS：https://feedx.net https://feedx.site",

The FBI said in a statement Sunday that it received preliminary results Saturday and is awaiting official confirmation.Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen at her Arizona home on Jan. 31 and was reported missing the following day.

The discovery was revealed days after investigators had released surveillance videos of the masked person outside Guthrie’s front door. A porch camera recorded video of a person with a backpack who was wearing a ski mask, long pants, jacket and gloves.\n    \n        \n    \n\nOn Thursday, the FBI called the person a suspect.

        "text": "A person places flowers in front of Nancy Guthrie’s home in Tucson, Ariz., on Friday, Feb. 13, 2026. (AP Photo/Ty ONeil)2026-02-15T13:24:26Z\n                                        TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Law enforcement agents have been gathering more potential evidence as the search for “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie ‘s mother heads into its third week. Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen at her Arizona home on Jan. 31 and was reported missing the following day. Authorities say her blood was found on the front porch. Purported ransom notes were sent to news outlets, but two deadlines for paying have passed.Authorities have expressed concern about Nancy Guthrie’s health because she needs vital daily medicine. She is said to have a pacemaker and have dealt with high blood pressure and heart issues, according to sheriff’s dispatcher audio on broadcastify.com.Here’s what to know about her disappearance and the intense search to find her:\n    \n        \n    \n\nVideo of masked manThe Federal Bureau of Investigation released surveillance videos of a masked person wearing a handgun holster outside Guthrie’s front door in Tucson the night she vanished. A porch camera recorded video of a person with a backpack who was wearing a ski mask, long pants, jacket and gloves. On Thursday, the FBI called the person a suspect. It described him as a man about 5 feet, 9 inches tall with a medium build. The agency said he was carrying a 25-liter “Ozark Trail Hiker Pack” backpack.Investigators initially said there was no surveillance video available since Guthrie didn’t have an active subscription to the doorbell camera company. But digital forensics experts kept working to find images in back-end software that might have been lost, corrupted or inaccessible.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nStudying DNAInvestigators collected DNA from Guthrie’s property which doesn’t belong to Guthrie or those in close contact with her, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said. Investigators are working to identify who it belongs to.Evidence requiring forensic analysis is being sent to the same out-of-state lab that has been used since the beginning of the case, the department said. Investigators found several gloves, the nearest about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from Guthrie’s home, and submitted them for lab analysis, the sheriff’s department said. It did not specify what type of gloves.The sheriff stressed his department is working closely with the FBI. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nSorting through tipsThe Pima County sheriff and the FBI announced phone numbers and a website to offer tips. Several hundred detectives and agents have been assigned to the case, the sheriff’s department said.The FBI said it has collected more than 13,000 tips since Feb. 1, the day Guthrie was reported missing. The sheriff’s department, meanwhile, said it has taken at least 18,000 calls. The sheriff’s department has not said whether any tips have advanced the investigation.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIntensive searchesLate Friday night, law enforcement sealed off a road about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from Guthrie’s home as part of their investigation. A parade of sheriff’s and FBI vehicles, including forensics vehicles, passed through the roadblock.The investigators also tagged and towed a Range Rover SUV from a nearby Culver’s restaurant parking lot late Friday.The sheriff’s department said Saturday the activity was part of the Guthrie investigation but no arrests were made. On Tuesday, sheriff deputies detained a person for questioning during a traffic stop south of Tucson. Authorities didn’t say what led them to stop the man but confirmed he was released. The same day, deputies and FBI agents conducted a court-authorized search in Rio Rico, about an hour’s drive south of the city. \n    \n        \n    \n\nFamily pleasSavannah Guthrie, her sister and her brother have shared on social media multiple video messages to their mother’s purported captor.The family’s Instagram videos have shifted in tone from impassioned pleas to whoever may have their mom, saying they want to talk and are even willing to pay a ransom, to bleaker and more desperate requests for the public’s help. The latest video on Thursday was simply a home video of their mother and a promise to “never give up on her.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nA quiet neighborhoodNancy Guthrie lived alone in the upscale Catalina Foothills neighborhood, where houses are spaced far apart and set back from the street by long driveways, gates and dense desert vegetation.Savannah Guthrie grew up in Tucson, graduated from the University of Arizona and once worked at a television station in the city, where her parents settled in the 1970s. She joined “Today” in 2011.In a video, she described her mother as a “loving woman of goodness and light.”",

(AP Photo/John Raoux)2026-02-15T19:35:16Z\n                                        DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Tyler Reddick won the Daytona 500 in a car owned by Michael Jordan when Chase Elliott crashed as he and Reddick were battling for the win. Reddick, in a Toyota for 23XI Racing, led only one lap on Sunday: the one to the checkered flag for the team owned by the NBA Hall of Famer and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin.“Just incredible how it all played out. Just true Daytona madness,” Reddick said. “I’ve already lost my voice from screaming. Never thought I’d be Daytona 500 champion.”Neither did Jordan, who met Reddick in victory lane for a bear hug and the two then jointly hoisted the Harley J. Earl trophy into the air. Jordan, who turns 63 on Tuesday, will get a Daytona 500 ring for his birthday and made it known in victory lane he wears a size 13. “It feels like I won a championship, but until I get my ring, I won’t even know,” Jordan said.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIt was a celebration that included multiple stars of NASCAR as Reddick is teammates with Bubba Wallace, who went to victory lane in tears after dominating a huge chunk of the race but finished 10th. Jordan wrapped his arms around Wallace from behind and spoke closely into Wallace’s ear in a brief speech of encouragement.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n“I don’t want my emotions to take away from the monumental day they just accomplished. Happy birthday, MJ. That’s a massive birthday present,” Wallace said. “I thought this was our week, the best 500 I’ve ever had, and come up short, sucks. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“Led a lot of laps, lap leader, I believe. It was a good day for us, but damn. Try again next year.”Hamlin was also in victory lane after finishing 31st and falling short in his bid to become the third four-time Daytona 500 winner.Hamlin, who drives for Joe Gibbs Racing, was involved in the final caution when he and teammate Christopher Bell collided with nine laps remaining. It set up the final push to the finish over the final four laps. \n    \n        \n    \n\nElliott had control on the final lap after leader Carson Hocevar was spun off the track and it appeared the son of NASCAR Hall of Famer Bill Elliott would finally win his first Daytona 500. Instead, Reddick made a huge surge, hit Elliott to cause Elliott to crash and sailed past to take Jordan to the Daytona International Speedway victory lane. Jordan was the face of the December federal antitrust lawsuit that NASCAR settled on the ninth day of trial. The settlement changed the revenue-sharing model in the United States’ top motorsports series. The victory marked a Daytona sweep for three team owners heavily involved in the trial. Bob Jenkins, who joined 23XI in suing NASCAR, opened the weekend with a victory when Chandler Smith won the Truck Series opener on Friday night for Front Row Motorsports.Richard Childress, who testified on behalf of 23XI and Front Row and was the subject of disparaging text messages by since-departed NASCAR chairman Steve Phelps, was the winning team owner Saturday when Austin Hill won. Then came “The Great American Race” and Jordan and Hamlin, the two front-facing litigants got their first Daytona 500 victory. \n    \n        \n    \n\nFormer race winners Ricky Stenhouse Jr. and Joey Logano finished second and third as Toyota, Chevrolet and Ford each placed a driver on the podium. Elliott wound up fourth and sat dejected and in disbelief on the outside wall of the track after climbing from his car. ___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JENNA FRYER\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Fryer primarily covers motorsports for The AP with an emphasis on NASCAR, F1, IMSA and IndyCar.

        "text": "Italy&#x27;s Federica Brignone shows her gold medal in an alpine ski, women&#x27;s giant slalom race, at the 2026 Winter Olympics, in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Italy, Sunday, Feb. 15, 2026. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)2026-02-15T16:34:47Z\n                                        MILAN (AP) — Federica Brignone and Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo glided into history at the Winter Olympics on Sunday in very different ways.Host nation Italy was delighted as Brignone’s sensational comeback continued with a second gold medal of the Olympics, still in pain after a badly broken leg last year.Klaebo has the most gold medals of any Winter Olympian in history with nine after taking gold with Norway’s cross-country men’s relay team.Brignone does it againWinning one gold medal in super-G made Brignone feel like she was living in a movie. What do great movies get? A sequel. The Italian skier known as the Tiger was unbeatable in the giant slalom for her second gold of the Olympics and fifth career medal, breaking her own record as the oldest women’s Alpine skiing Olympic champion for good measure.There were two silver medalists as Sara Hector and Thea Louise Stjernesund finished in exactly the same time and bowed to Brignone to mark her victory. \n    \n        \n    \n\nAfter breaking multiple bones in March, Brignone needed two surgeries and 42 stitches to put her leg back together. She only returned to skiing in January. Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States was 11th and has now failed to win a medal in eight straight Olympic races since the Winter Games in 2018.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nRecord ninth gold medal for Norwegian skierKlaebo stands alone as the most successful Winter Olympian of all time after winning his ninth career gold medal in cross-country skiing. Norway’s Prime Minister was watching as Klaebo anchored his team’s relay gold Sunday. That broke a tie on eight gold medals with three other Norwegians: cross-country skiers Marit Bjoergen and Bjoern Daehlie and biathlete Ole Einar Bjoerndalen.Klaebo could get into double figures by the end of the Milan Cortina Games. His next chances for a 10th gold are in the team sprint on Wednesday or the 50-kilometer race on Saturday. He’s still only 29.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nAnother win for the moguls kingMikael Kingsbury of Canada has won almost everything there is to win in moguls skiing. When they added a new Olympic event, he won that too. Kingsbury took gold, his fifth career Olympic medal, in the inaugural dual moguls event Sunday, three days after settling for silver in the traditional moguls event in a surprise win for Australian Cooper Woods.Britain won its first-ever Olympic gold in any snow sport with victory for Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale in team snowboardcross.Biathlon saw a first Olympic gold for Italy as Lisa Vitozzi won the women’s pursuit, hours after Sweden’s Martin Ponsiluoma’s surprise gold in the men’s event.\n    \n        \n    \n\nStill to comeLater Sunday, Dutch speedskater Jutta Leerdam and Erin Jackson of the United States compete for the women’s 500-meter gold. Leerdam, whose fiance is influencer and boxer Jake Paul, is aiming for a second gold after winning the 1,000, while Jackson won the 500 at the 2022 Olympics and carried the U.S. flag at the opening ceremony in Milan.Medals are also on offer in the women’s ski jumping large hill event and team skeleton. The pairs figure skating competition begins with the free skate and the United States plays Germany in men’s hockey aiming to secure a quarterfinal place.___AP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

(AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey)2026-02-15T17:02:44Z\n                                        ATLANTA (AP) — A storm system sweeping across the Southeast late Saturday and Sunday brought tornado warnings to Mississippi and Louisiana, and then took aim at parts of Georgia and Florida, as people in the Northeast were finally getting a reprieve from weeks of bitterly cold temperatures.Some of the fiercest storms in the South were reported near Lake Charles, Louisiana, where high winds from a thunderstorm overturned a horse trailer and a Mardi Gras float, damaged an airport jet bridge and flung the metal awning from a house into power lines. The damage was documented by National Weather Service employees who surveyed the area.Power poles were snapped and toppled near the Louisiana towns of Jena, Cheneyville and Donaldsonville, the weather service reported.No deaths or serious injuries were reported, but the damage reports came as the storm system continued its path into parts of south Georgia and the Florida Panhandle, which were under tornado watches on Sunday.\n    \n        \n    \n\nMeanwhile, the Northeast was beginning to thaw after a weeks-long stretch of uncommonly cold weather.Boston was running nearly 7 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 14 Celsius) below average for February by midweek, and the city was on pace for its coldest winter in more than a decade. Boston remained cold on Sunday, but the week’s forecast called for temperatures climbing into the high 30s and low 40s, which is closer to the seasonal average.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nElsewhere in the U.S., parts of California were bracing for showers, thunderstorms and snow showers. Jacob Spender, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Sacramento, said a storm system was moving on shore in California throughout Sunday and through the week.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nHeavy snow was forecast for elevated areas, Spender said.“As we get up into the mountains and the foothills, we’re going to be looking at some snowfall,” Spender said. “So there will be snowfall all the way down into the foothills as well.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nSpender said people should heed travel advisories in the coming days.“So if they are traveling, packing winter safety kits. Anything to be prepared. This is a bigger system, and a major system,” Spender said.—-Associated Press journalists Julie Walker in New York City; Patrick Whittle in Portland, Maine; and Jeff Martin in Atlanta contributed.",

The last three years have shattered previous records for such events. Last Wednesday, scientists said that we are closer than ever to the point after which global heating cannot be stopped.Just one day later, Donald Trump and Lee Zeldin, the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, announced the elimination of the Obama-era endangerment finding which underpins federal climate regulations. Scrapping it is just one part of Mr Trump’s assault on environmental controls and promotion of fossil fuels. But it may be his most consequential. Any fragment of hope may lie in the fact that a president who has called global heating a “hoax” framed this primarily as about deregulation – perhaps because the science is now so widely accepted even in the US.

Here in York the river is getting above itself yet again and the council has fenced off large puddles in the park for health and safety reasons, to widespread mockery. Things currently taking in water include the letterbox (yesterday the postman told me with a manic laugh that he was leaving for the Philippines), the hens, my shoes and our car, which is growing moss around the windows.

I don’t mean farmers, for whom it’s a catastrophe, flood victims or the poor folk of Cardinham, North Wyke and Astwood Bank, who endured a biblical 40 days straight of rain. They’re entitled to rend their garments and corral their pets into boats, two by two. But maybe the rest of us, just dealing with it being “quite wet”, could get a grip. When life gives you rain, make rain-ade (do not drink rain; it’s full of forever chemicals)!

        "title": "NASA Let AI Drive the Perseverance Rover",
        "text": "In December, NASA took another small, incremental step towards autonomous surface rovers. In a demonstration, the Perseverance team used AI to generate the rover’s waypoints. Perseverance used the AI waypoints on two separate days, traveling a total of 456 meters without human control.“This demonstration shows how far our capabilities have advanced and broadens how we will explore other worlds,” said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. “Autonomous technologies like this can help missions to operate more efficiently, respond to challenging terrain, and increase science return as distance from Earth grows. It’s a strong example of teams applying new technology carefully and responsibly in real operations.”\n\n\n\nMars is a long way away, and there’s about a 25-minute delay for a round trip signal between Earth and Mars. That means that one way or another, rovers are on their own for short periods of time.The delay shapes the route-planning process. Rover drivers here on Earth examine images and elevation data and program a series of waypoints, which usually don’t exceed 100 meters apart. The driving plan is sent to NASA’s Deep Space Network (DSN), which transmits it to one of several orbiters, which then relay it to Perseverance. (Perseverance can receive direct comms from the DSN as a back up, but the data rate is slower.)AI Enhances Mars Rover NavigationIn this demonstration, the AI model analyzed orbital images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE camera, as well as digital elevation models. The AI, which is based on Anthropic’s Claude AI, identified hazards like sand traps, boulder fields, bedrock, and rocky outcrops. Then it generated a path defined by a series of waypoints that avoids the hazards. From there, Perseverance’s auto-navigation system took over. It has more autonomy than its predecessors and can process images and driving plans while in motion.There was another important step before these waypoints were transmitted to Perseverance. NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory has a “twin” for Perseverance called the “Vehicle System Test Bed” (VSTB) in JPL’s Mars Yard. It’s an engineering model that the team can work with here on Earth to solve problems, or for situations like this. These engineering versions are common on Mars missions, and JPL has one for Curiosity, too.“The fundamental elements of generative AI are showing a lot of promise in streamlining the pillars of autonomous navigation for off-planet driving: perception (seeing the rocks and ripples), localization (knowing where we are), and planning and control (deciding and executing the safest path),” said Vandi Verma, a space roboticist at JPL and a member of the Perseverance engineering team. “We are moving towards a day where generative AI and other smart tools will help our surface rovers handle kilometer-scale drives while minimizing operator workload, and flag interesting surface features for our science team by scouring huge volumes of rover images.”AI’s Expanding Role in Space ExplorationAI is rapidly becoming ubiquitous in our lives, showing up in places that don’t necessarily have a strong use case for it. But this isn’t NASA hopping on the AI bandwagon. They’ve been developing automatic navigation systems for a while, out of necessity. In fact, Perseverance’s primary means of driving is its self-driving autonomous navigation system.One thing that prevents fully-autonomous driving is the way uncertainty grows as the rover operates without human assistance. The longer the rover travels, the more uncertain it becomes about its position on the surface. The solution is to re-localize the rover on its map. Currently, humans do this. But this takes time, including a complete communication cycle between Earth and Mars. Overall, it limits how far Perseverance can go without a helping hand.NASA/JPL is also working on a way that Perseverance can use AI to re-localize. The main roadblock is matching orbital images with the rover’s ground-level images. It seems highly likely that AI will be trained to excel at this.It’s obvious that AI is set to play a much larger role in planetary exploration. The next Mars rover may be much different than current ones, with more advanced autonomous navigation and other AI features. There are already concepts for a swarm of flying drones released by a rover to expand its explorative reach on Mars. These swarms would be controlled by AI to work together and autonomously.And it’s not just Mars exploration that will benefit from AI. NASA’s Dragonfly mission to Saturn’s moon Titan will make extensive use of AI. Not only for autonomous navigation as the rotorcraft flies around, but also for autonomous data curation.“Imagine intelligent systems not only on the ground at Earth, but also in edge applications in our rovers, helicopters, drones, and other surface elements trained with the collective wisdom of our NASA engineers, scientists, and astronauts,” said Matt Wallace, manager of JPL’s Exploration Systems Office. “That is the game-changing technology we need to establish the infrastructure and systems required for a permanent human presence on the Moon and take the U.S. to Mars and beyond.”",

        "text": "SummaryThe Year of the Fire Horse (2026) sees luxury brands moving beyond simple envelopes into elaborate gift sets and collectiblesHermès and Louis Vuitton focus on art and tradition with 3D watercolor horses and ancient scrollsGucci and Rimowa deliver heavy-hitting lifestyle objects, including a full Mahjong set and a wooden music box, while Victorinox and KENZO blend utility with playfulnessAs we gallop into the Year of the Fire Horse, the humble red packet has transcended its role as a mere vessel for lucky money to become the centerpiece of elaborate luxury gift sets. 2026’s zodiac sign—celebrated for its untamed spirit and blazing energy—has inspired a shift from simple paper stationery to tangible artifacts of culture and leisure. From the gaming tables of Gucci to the nostalgic melodies of Rimowa, here are the most coveted red packets and gifts for Lunar New Year 2026.The Parisian heavyweights have turned to art history and ancient custom for their 2026 offerings. Hermès, synonymous with equestrian excellence, delivers a masterpiece of paper engineering. Their packet unfolds to reveal a stunning 3D pop-up of a horse galloping, rendered in delicate watercolor strokes that capture the fluidity and grace of the animal in motion. Louis Vuitton takes a scholarly approach to tradition; their red packets are presented alongside ancient blessings written on miniature scrolls, blending the Maison's travel heritage with the solemnity of centuries-old rituals. Gucci, known for its maximalist flair, wins the award for the most extravagant centerpiece. Going far beyond the envelope, the House has gifted top-tier clients a full, limited-edition mahjong set. Encased in signature leather, the tiles feature subtle Fire Horse motifs, ensuring the brand is front and center during family gatherings.In the lifestyle sector, brands are focusing on tactile experiences and nostalgia. Rimowa steps away from its signature grooved aluminum aesthetic this year to offer something surprisingly warm and traditional: an ancient wooden music box. Victorinox pairs its famed utility with ceremonial calm. Their Lunar New Year set includes a themed Swiss Army Knife featuring the Fire Horse emblem, accompanied by an ancient tea set, encouraging recipients to carve out a moment of peace amidst the festive rush. Meanwhile, KENZO, under the playful direction of NIGO, captures the moment literally and figuratively. Their gift set includes a keychain of the iconic Boke flower alongside a fully functioning mini pocket camera, inviting the new generation to document their celebrations in lo-fi style.Time is of the essence in the Year of the Horse, but the top watchmakers have chosen timelessness over trend. Rolex eschews the zodiac animal entirely, keeping their design strictly classic. Their packets feature the brand's signature green and gold palette with the coronet logo, offering a \"quiet luxury\" alternative to the season's noisy graphics. Parmigiani Fleurier takes a cerebral approach, showcasing their horological mastery with a design inspired by the Chinese round zodiac calendar. The packet features a complex, dial-like motif representing the lunisolar cycle, directly referencing their Tonda PF Xiali calendar complications.For the sportswear giants, the Year of the Fire Horse is less about flashy reinterpretations and more about clean, impactful iconography. Nike and Jordan Brand strip back the bells and whistles, opting for straightforward, dignified horse motifs that integrate seamlessly with their logos, avoiding the \"fire\" gimmicks for a cleaner athletic aesthetic. BAPE delivers a premium touch to streetwear, featuring its classic Ape Head logo embossed in rich gold thread, signaling a move towards craftsmanship and texture over their usual bold camo prints.Whether it is the clatter of Gucci Mahjong tiles or the tune of a Rimowa music box, the 2026 Fire Horse designs represent a high-octane, luxurious start to a prosperous new year.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "SummaryLEGO has unveiled the \"Claude Monet – Bridge over a Pond of Water Lilies\" set, developed in collaboration with The Metropolitan Museum of ArtThe 3,179-piece set recreates Monet's 1899 oil painting using a unique layering technique to mimic Impressionist brushstrokesInsiders get early access on March 1, 2026, with a general release following on March 4LEGO is bringing the serenity of Giverny to living room walls with its latest addition to the LEGO Art series. In collaboration with The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the brand has revealed \"Claude Monet – Bridge over a Pond of Water Lilies\" (31220), a massive 3,179-piece tribute to the French Impressionist’s most iconic subject. The set reimagines the 1899 masterpiece not just as a flat mosaic, but as a textured, three-dimensional relief that uses unconventional bricks to capture the depth and vibrancy of the original oil painting.Measuring over 20 inches high and 16 inches wide, the build is designed to be viewed from two perspectives: from afar, it resolves into a peaceful Impressionist landscape, while up close, it reveals a chaotic, playful use of parts. The design team has employed a \"tactile 3D surface\" technique, layering tiles and plates to simulate Monet’s signature brushwork on \"The Water-Lily Pond\" (1899). Notably, the foliage and water textures are constructed using surprising elements—including swords, bananas, butterfly wings, and cherries—repurposed to create the organic shapes of the water lilies and weeping willows.The set is more than just a display piece; it serves as an interactive art history lesson. Builders can scan a QR code in the instruction booklet to access an exclusive podcast featuring a curator from The Met, providing context on Monet’s life, his garden, and the inspiration behind the painting.The artwork comes fully framed within the build and includes a specialized hanging mechanism, making it ready for immediate display. The LEGO Art \"Claude Monet – Bridge over a Pond of Water Lilies\" will be available to LEGO Insiders for early access starting March 1, 2026, with a general release on March 4, 2026. The set will be sold via LEGO and stores globally.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",
