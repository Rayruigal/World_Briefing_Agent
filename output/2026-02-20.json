Based on the critically lauded play by David Haig, the film zeroes in on the intense tactical standoff that determined the fate of the Normandy landings.The true story follows Britain’s chief meteorological officer James Stagg (played by Andrew Scott) as he is called upon to deliver the most crucial forecast of the 20th century. A wrong prediction could lead to absolute disaster for the largest seaborne invasion ever attempted, while any delay risks German intelligence catching on to the Allied forces' movements.This impossible situation locks Stagg into a tense confrontation with the entire Allied leadership. Ultimately, the final decision rests on the shoulders of Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower (Fraser). With the fate of the war and the lives of millions hanging in the balance, the 72-hour window becomes a gripping test of strategy and conviction. The film's ensemble cast is rounded out by Kerry Condon and Damian Lewis, with Anthony Maras handling directorial duties.Watch the trailer above.

        "text": "President Donald Trump gestures during a Black History Month event in the East Room of the White House, Wednesday, Feb. 18, 2026, in Washington. (AP Photo/Nathan Howard)2026-02-19T11:16:44Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — Tariffs paid by midsize U.S. businesses tripled over the course of past year, new research tied to one of America’s leading banks showed on Thursday — more evidence that President Donald Trump ‘s push to charge higher taxes on imports is causing economic disruption.The additional taxes have meant that companies that employ a combined 48 million people in the U.S. — the kinds of businesses that Trump had promised to revive — have had to find ways to absorb the new expense, by passing it along to customers in the form of higher prices, employing fewer workers or accepting lower profits.“That’s a big change in their cost of doing business,” said Chi Mac, business research director of the JPMorganChase Institute, which published the analysis Thursday. “We also see some indications that they may be shifting away from transacting with China and maybe toward some other regions in Asia.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe research does not say how the additional costs are flowing through the economy, but it indicates that tariffs are being paid by U.S. companies. The study is part of a growing body of economic analyses that counter the administration’s claims that foreigners pay the tariffs.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe JPMorganChase Institute report used payments data to look at businesses that might lack the pricing power of large multinational companies to offset tariffs, but may be small enough to quickly change supply chains to minimize exposure to the tax increases. The companies tended to have revenues between $10 million and $1 billion with fewer than 500 employees, a category known as “middle market.”\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n        \n                \n            \n        \n                \n            \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    AP AUDIO: Tariffs paid by midsize US companies tripled last year, a JPMorganChase Institute study shows\n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    AP’s Lisa Dwyer reports on research showing Tariffs are hitting the bottom line.\n    \n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe analysis suggests that the Trump administration’s goal of becoming less directly reliant on Chinese manufacturers has been occurring. Payments to China by these companies were 20% below their October 2024 levels, but it’s unclear whether that means China is simply routing its goods through other countries or if supply chains have moved.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe authors of the analysis emphasized in an interview that companies are still adjusting to the tariffs and said they plan to continue studying the issue.The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the analysis, which showed that U.S. companies are paying tariffs that the president had previously claimed would be paid by foreign entities.Trump imposed a series of tariffs last year for the ostensible goal of reducing the U.S. trade imbalance with other countries, so that America was not longer importing more than it exports. But trade data published Thursday by the Census Bureau showed that the trade deficit climbed last year by $25.5 billion to $1.24 trillion. The president on Wednesday posted on social media that he expected there would be a trade surplus “during this year.”The Trump administration has been adamant that the tariffs are a boon for the economy, businesses, and workers. Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, lashed out on Wednesday at research by the New York Federal Reserve showing that nearly 90% of the burden for Trump’s tariffs fell on U.S. companies and consumers.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“The paper is an embarrassment,” Hassett told CNBC. “It’s, I think, the worst paper I’ve ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined.”Trump increased the average tariff rate to 13% from 2.6% last year, according to the New York Fed researchers. He declared that tariffs on some items such as steel, kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities were in the national security interest of the country. He also declared an economic emergency to bypass Congress and impose a baseline tax on goods from much of the world in April 2025 at an event he called “Liberation Day.”The high rates provoked a financial market panic, prompting Trump to walk back his rates and then engage in talks with multiple countries that led to a set of new trade frameworks. The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on whether Trump surpassed his legal authority by declaring an economic emergency.\n    \n        \n    \n\nTrump was elected in 2024 on his promise to tame inflation, but his tariffs have contributed to voter frustration over affordability. While inflation has not spiked during Trump’s term thus far, hiring slowed sharply and a team of academic economists estimate that consumer prices were roughly 0.8 percentage points higher than they would otherwise be.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JOSH BOAK\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Boak covers the White House and economic policy for The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Noah Berger, File)2026-02-19T13:41:34Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. trade deficit slipped modestly in 2025, a year in which President Donald Trump upended global commerce by slapping double digit tariffs on imports from most countries. But the gap in the trade of goods such machinery and aircraft — the main focus of Trump’s protectionist policies — hit a record last year despite sweeping import taxes.Overall, the gap the between the goods and services the U.S. sells other countries and what it buys from them narrowed to just over $901 billion, from $904 billion in 2024, but it was still the third-highest on record, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.Exports rose 6% last year, and imports rose nearly 5%.And the U.S. deficit in the trade of goods widened 2% to a record $1.24 trillion last year as American companies boosted imports of computer chips and other tech goods from Taiwan to support massive investments in artificial intelligence.\n    \n        \n    \n\nAmid continuing tensions with Bejing, the deficit in the goods trade with China plunged nearly 32% to $202 billion in 2025 on a sharp drop in both exports to and imports from the world’s second-biggest economy. But trade was diverted away from China. The goods gap with Taiwan doubled to $147 billion and shot up 44%, to $178 billion, with Vietnam.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nEconomist Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the widening gaps with Taiwan and Vietnam might put a “bulls eye’’ on them this year if Trump focuses more on the lopsided trade numbers and less on the U.S. rivalry with China.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nIn 2025, U.S. goods imports from Mexico outpaced exports by nearly $197 billion, up from a 2024 gap of $172 billion. But the goods deficit with Canada shrank by 26% to $46 billion. The United States this year is negotiating a renewal of a pact Trump reached with those two countries in his first term.The U.S. ran a bigger surplus in the trade of services such as banking and tourism last year — $339 billion, up from $312 billion in 2024.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe trade gap surged from January-March as U.S. companies tried to import foreign goods ahead of Trump’s taxes, then narrowed most of the rest of the year.Trump’s tariffs are a tax paid by U.S. importers and often passed along to their customers as higher prices. But they haven’t had as much impact on inflation as economists originally expected. Trump argues that the tariffs will protect U.S. industries, bringing manufacturing back to America and raise money for the U.S. Treasury.",

        "text": "SummaryBloomberg reports suggest Sony is considering pushing the PlayStation 6 debut to 2028 or 2029A massive spike in RAM and NAND storage prices has reportedly disrupted Sony's hardware strategyThe delay could leave the PlayStation 5 Pro as Sony's flagship console for over three yearsSony is reportedly exploring a significant delay for its next-generation gaming console, the PlayStation 6, as the tech industry grapples with a catastrophic global memory shortage. According to Bloomberg, the device that was once expected to arrive as early as 2027 may now be pushed back several years due to market volatility.Industry insiders have dubbed the current crisis \"RAMageddon,\" a phenomenon driven largely by the insatiable demand for memory chips from AI data centers. Reports indicate that the price of 16GB of DDR RAM has surged by approximately 515% in just a few months, while 512GB of NAND storage costs have risen by nearly 479%. These economic pressures are said to be forcing Sony Group Corp. to rethink its carefully orchestrated release cadence, which typically sees a new generation every seven years.The suggested delay is aimed at waiting for component prices to stabilize before committing to a mass-market retail price for the PS6. If the rumors hold true, the move would mark a major shift in the console war, potentially giving competitors an opening while extending the lifecycle of the existing PlayStation 5 and the recently released PlayStation 5 Pro. Suggested imagery from various reports points toward a strategy of sustaining user engagement through firmware updates and mid-generation hardware while the industry waits for the chip market to catch up with demand.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "Marisa Pierce, center right, the daughter of yogurt shop suspect Maurice Pierce, hugs Sharon Shipman, the mother of yogurt shop suspect Forrest Welborn, as they arrive at the exoneration hearing for four men wrongfully accused in the 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders at the Blackwell-Thurman Criminal Justice Center in Austin on Thursday, Feb. 19, 2026. (Jay Janner/Austin American-Statesman via AP)2026-02-19T05:02:44Z\n                                        AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A Texas judge on Thursday declared four men who were wrongfully accused of the 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders innocent, formally clearing their names in a courtroom for the first time since the killings of four teenage girls that haunted the city for decades. “You are innocent,” state District Judge Dayna Blazey said during a hearing in a packed Austin courtroom. The declaration was aimed at closing a dark chapter for the men and their families, and for a city that was shaken by the brutality of the crime and investigators’ inability to solve it for decades. Blazey called her order “an obligation to the rule of law and the obligation to the dignity of the individual.”Cold case detectives announced last year that they had connected the killings to a suspect who died in a 1999 standoff with police in Missouri. Two of the original four suspects, Michael Scott and Forrest Welborn, were in the packed courtroom with family members to hear prosecutors tell the judge that they are innocent. Robert Springsteen, who was initially convicted and spent several years on death row, did not attend. Maurice Pierce died in 2010.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“Over 25 years ago, the state prosecuted four innocent men ... (for) one of the worst crimes Austin has ever seen,” Travis County First Assistant District Attorney Trudy Strassburger said at the opening of the hearing. “We could not have been more wrong.”\n\nA declaration of “actual innocence” would also be a key step for the men and their families to seek financial compensation for years they spent in jail or in prison.“All four lived under the specter of the yogurt shop murders. These four never had the chance to live normal lives,” Strassburger said.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe murders shocked Austin and confounded investigators for yearsAmy Ayers, 13; Eliza Thomas, 17; and sisters Jennifer and Sarah Harbison, ages 17 and 15, were bound, gagged and shot in the head at the “I Can’t Believe It’s Yogurt” store where two of them worked. The building was set on fire.Investigators chased thousands of leads and several false confessions before the four men were arrested in late 1999.Springsteen and Scott were convicted based largely on confessions they insisted were coerced by police. Both convictions were overturned in the mid-2000s.Welborn was charged but never tried after two grand juries refused to indict him. Pierce spent three years in jail before the charges were dismissed and he was released.\n    \n        \n    \n\nProsecutors wanted to try Springsteen and Scott again, but a judge ordered the charges dismissed in 2009 when new DNA tests that were unavailable in 1991 had revealed another male suspect. “Let us not forgot that Robert Springsteen could be dead right now, executed at the hands of the state of Texas,” Springsteen attorney Amber Farrelly said at the hearing.Connection to a new suspect revealed The case effectively went cold until 2025. It got new public attention when an HBO documentary series explored the unsolved crime. Investigators announced in September that new evidence and reviews of old evidence pointed to Robert Eugene Brashers as the killer.Since 2018, authorities had used advanced DNA evidence to link Brashers to the strangulation death of a South Carolina woman in 1990, the 1997 rape of a 14-year-old girl in Tennessee and the shooting of a mother and daughter in Missouri in 1998.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe link to the Austin case came when a DNA sample taken from under Ayers’ fingernail came back as a match to Brashers from the 1990 murder in South Carolina. Austin investigators also found that Brashers had been arrested at a border checkpoint near El Paso two days after the yogurt shop killings. In his stolen car was a pistol that matched the same caliber used to kill one of the girls in Austin.Police also noted similarities in the yogurt shop case to Brashers’ other crimes: The victims were tied up with their own clothing, sexually assaulted and some crime scenes were set on fire. Brashers died in 1999 when he shot himself during an hourslong standoff with police at a motel in Kennett, Missouri.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JIM VERTUNO\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Vertuno has been covering news, sports and politics from Texas for The AP since 1998.

        "title": "Iranians grieve defiantly for thousands killed in last month’s crackdown",
        "text": "In this image from video circulating on social media, verified by the AP and posted on 17 February, 2026, attendees shout anti-government slogans in Abdanan, Iran, during a memorial known as &quot;chehelom,&quot; Persian for &quot;the 40th,&quot; marking 40 days since a man was killed during protests. Chehelom ceremonies are traditionally held by families 40 days after a death, but during periods of unrest they can take on a political dimension.(UGC via AP)2026-02-19T17:04:04Z\n                                        CAIRO (AP) — Standing on her balcony in the Iranian capital, Tehran, the teacher shouted out into the darkness, “Death to the dictator!” and “Death to the murderer, Khamenei!” on a recent night, joining the slogans coming from windows and rooftops around her relatively affluent neighborhood.A few voices in the darkness responded with slogans in support of Iran’s 47-year-old Islamic Republic.“Shut up! Choke on it!” her neighbors shouted back, drowning out the pro-government voices, the teacher recounted to The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity for her safety.Iranians across the country are still reeling with shock, grief and fear after massive nationwide protests were crushed by the deadliest crackdown ever seen under the rule of the 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Thousands were killed and tens of thousands are believed to have been arrested.\n    \n        \n    \n\nBut a vein of defiance persists. A seething anger at Iran’s rulers is evident in videos shared on social media and in conversations with protesters. At the same time, three protesters reached by the AP also expressed futility over what can be done after hundreds of thousands braved taking to the streets only to be met with overwhelming violence. The protesters all spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution or arrest.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nAdding to the uncertainty is the United States’ threat to strike Iran. The U.S. has positioned warships and fighter jets nearby even as it holds negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe defiance appears in the shouting of slogans from windows and rooftops at night, a ritual displayed in past waves of protests.It is also evident at memorial gatherings for those killed 40 days earlier. Such commemorations -- known as the “chehelom,” Persian for “the 40th” – are traditionally held by families for anyone who has died. But in times of unrest, chehelom can have a political dimension.\n    \n        \n    \n\nCommemorations turn to protestsThis week marks 40 days since Jan. 8 and 9, the deadliest days of the crackdown, and multiple videos circulating online show 40-day ceremonies in towns and cities around Iran. Some appear to have drawn hundreds of people, who often break into anti-government chants.Often they are festive, with friends and loved ones of the slain protester singing and throwing flowers – a rejection of the solemn atmosphere encouraged by the state at official ceremonies. Most avoid calling the dead “shaheed,” or “martyr,” a term with Islamic religious connotations. Instead, they use the term, “javid nam,” a Persian phrase meaning, “Long live the name.”Videos posted this week and verified by the AP showed a crowd of hundreds at the main cemetery in the small western Iranian town of Abdanan, chanting, “Death to Khamenei” and pumping their fists at the chehelom of Alireza Seydi, a 16-year-old boy killed on Jan. 8. The videos show security forces firing from an armored vehicle, raising clouds of what appeared to be tear gas, sending men and women running.During the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the shah and brought the Islamic Republic to power, 40-day memorials for slain protesters often turned into rallies that security forces tried to crush, causing new deaths – which then would be marked 40 days later with new protests.\n    \n        \n    \n\nPostings on social media have reported security forces trying to restrict people from attending some chehelom ceremonies. “For every person killed, a thousand more stand behind him,” a crowd of several hundred chanted Tuesday while gathered in the eastern city of Mashhad for the chehelom of Hamid Mahdavi, according to a video verified by the AP. When a few police officers harassed some people commemorating Mahdavi, a fireman shot to death in January protests, the crowd shouted, “Shameless! Shameless!”The government held its own chehelom for those killed, whom the Revolutionary Guard in a statement depicted as victims of violence caused by foreign-backed armed “terrorist” groups that exploited “legitimate public demands.” It said the 40-day commemoration was “a chance to renew commitment to national unity.”\n    \n        \n    \n\n‘Mass depression’ and anger“More than sad, people are angry. Everyone is so angry. Everyone is waiting for some kind of explosion,” said a resident of Karaj, a city just outside of Tehran. He joined street marches on Jan. 8 and Jan. 9 and said five of his relatives and family friends were killed when security forces opened fire on protesters.The Human Rights Activists News Agency has so far counted more than 7,000 dead and believes the death toll is far higher. Iran’s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed; it has depicted many of the protesters as “terrorists.” “I don’t know anyone around me who doesn’t know someone who was killed, or someone who was arrested or wounded,” the 26-year-old teacher in Tehran said. Two of her acquaintances were killed and the husband of one of her co-workers arrested, she said.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIranians are also struggling with a rapidly worsening economy, as the value of their currency plummets.Every day, prices rise, said the Karaj resident. “We are getting near an economic collapse,” he said. “Buying fruit has become a luxury.”A resident of north Tehran who works in tourism and joined last month’s protests said that with the Persian New Year approaching in March, the bazaar would usually be full of shoppers, but not now.“It’s a combination of grieving, lack of money and inflation,” he said, describing people in the capital as being in a state of “mass depression.”The mood has dampened Iran’s normally vibrant cultural sphere. One prominent actor posted that she would no longer accept new roles “in this land that smells of blood.”Alireza Ostad Haji, who referees a popular television strongman competition, offered condolences to “all mourning families” in an Instagram post and resigned from two national athletic committees. He broke down in tears as he spoke of a former bodybuilding champion, Masoud Zatparvar, who was killed. “He was not a terrorist, he was a protester,” he said.‘They see no alternative’There is also a fear that street protests can’t bring change in the face of the state’s overwhelming use of violence. The Karaj resident and the Tehran protester who works in tourism both expressed support for the son of the ousted shah, Reza Pahlavi, who from exile has put himself forward as a leader of the fragmented Iranian opposition. Pahlavi has encouraged protests and called for the U.S. to strike Iran.The depth of support for Pahlavi around Iran is impossible to gauge. But during January’s wave of protests, chants in support of him were common, a notable change from the past, when the shah’s son drew scant attention within the country or was seen as out of touch.Some are even taking what was a previously unimaginable step for many -- expressing hopes for an American attack.“Every night, every hour, I wish I could hear (U.S.) strikes,” the protester who works in tourism said. “We cannot fight anymore with our fists against machine guns.” He said many of his friends who took to the streets alongside him in January say they won’t do so again because of the state’s violence.The teacher said that, while she joined past protests, she didn’t in January because she didn’t like the expressions of Pahlavi support.But she said some of her friends who also oppose the shah’s son joined the January protests and even repeated the slogan, “Long live the shah!”“People have become very tired, and they see no alternative,” she said.She worried a U.S. attack will bring war, civil strife and even more bloodshed. “I am afraid there will be more massacres,” she said.___Chehayeb reported from Beirut.

        "text": "Reporters stand in front of Buckingham Palace in London, Thursday, Feb. 19, 2026 after Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested by British police on suspicion of misconduct in public office. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung)2026-02-19T15:03:57Z\n                                        LONDON (AP) — Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office that is centered on his close relationship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. His arrest Thursday follows years of allegations over his links with Epstein, who took his own life in a New York prison in 2019. The accusation at the heart of his arrest is that he shared confidential trade information with the disgraced financier.It is one of the gravest crises to affect the House of Windsor since its establishment more than a hundred years ago. Arguably, only the abdication of King Edward VIII in 1936 and the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997 have been graver for the institution of the British monarchy.Here’s what to know:\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe arrestMountbatten-Windsor was taken into custody Thursday morning by officers from Thames Valley Police at King Charles III’s private retreat in Sandringham, where the former prince is now living.The arrest follows a ratcheting up of allegations against Mountbatten-Windsor in the wake of the release of millions of pages of files last month related to Epstein by the U.S. Justice Department. Many of the allegations center on sexual impropriety on the part of Mountbatten-Windsor, specifically that a woman was trafficked to the U.K. by Epstein to have a sexual encounter with the then-prince. However, he has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe suspicionThe Crown Prosecution Service, which decides on whether a charge has the potential to lead to a successful prosecution, defines the misconduct in public office as the “serious willful abuse or neglect of the power or responsibilities of the public office held.”Thames Valley Police said it was “assessing” reports that Mountbatten-Windsor sent confidential trade reports to Epstein in 2010, when the former prince was Britain’s special envoy for international trade. Other police forces in the U.K. are also conducting their own investigations.Specifically, emails released as part of the Epstein files appeared to show Mountbatten-Windsor sharing reports of official visits to Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore. One email, dated November 2010, appeared to be forwarded by Andrew five minutes after he had been sent it. In another, on Christmas Eve 2010, he appeared to send Epstein a confidential brief on investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Helmand Province, Afghanistan.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe potential sentenceThe offense technically carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, but experts say a shorter term would be more likely if he is convicted by a jury.Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any impropriety but has not commented on the most recent allegations.Experts said that proving misconduct in a public office is notoriously difficult to prove.“Firstly, it must be determined if Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was in a role within government that constitutes the title of public officer,” said Sean Caulfield, a criminal defense lawyer at Hodge Jones &amp; Allen. In recent years, prison officers have been prosecuted for the offense after having inappropriate relationships with inmates, as well as police officers leaking information.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe coming hoursPolice have the power to search Mountbatten-Windsor’s properties, and formal questions can now be put to him during interviews. Under UK law, police can hold a suspect without charging them for up to 24 hours from the time of arrest. This can be extended to a maximum of 96 hours. The police can then release Mountbatten-Windsor on bail if there’s not enough evidence to charge him.It is unclear where exactly Mountbatten-Windsor is being questioned, but he is likely to have had his mug shot taken before heading into the confines of a small interview room. If he hasn’t got a lawyer, then police would offer one. The lawyer may advise Mountbatten-Windsor to say “no comment” to each question as is his right.\n    \n        \n    \n\nSearches are being carried out at addresses in Berkshire, west of London, and Norfolk, northeast of the capital. Windsor Castle, within which Mountbatten-Windsor lived until earlier this month, is in Berkshire, while Sandringham is in Norfolk.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service will need to make a decision about charging him.Andrew Gilmore, a partner at Grosvenor Law, said that prosecutors will apply the two-stage test known as the “Code for Crown Prosecutors.”“That test is to determine whether there is a more realistic prospect of a conviction than not based on the evidence and whether the matter is in the public interest,” he said. “If these two tests are met, then the matter will be charged and proceed to court.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe responseMountbatten-Windsor’s arrest is not a huge surprise, but it is a consequential moment in the history of the modern monarchy. You have to go back to the arrest of King Charles I almost 400 years for an example of a senior British royal being arrested. That turned into a seismic moment in British history, leading to revolution, Charles’ beheading and the temporary abolition of the monarchy.After Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest Thursday, King Charles III said that the law must take its course in the investigation as he sought to distance the royal family from his brother.“As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter,” the king said in a statement signed Charles R. “My family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.’’His wife, Queen Camilla, did not comment when questions were shouted to her outside a lunchtime orchestral concert in London. Camilla waved to cameras but did not respond.Mountbatten-Windsor’s former wife, Sarah Ferguson, has yet to comment. She has faced her own allegations in connection with her dealings with Epstein.",

        "text": "SummaryAudi Sport introduces its first-ever high-performance PHEV pairing a 2.9-liter twin-turbo V6 with a 130 kW electric motorThe model debuts \"Dynamic Torque Control\" which utilizes an electromechanical rear transaxle to shift torque in millisecondsEuropean order books are set to open in early 2026 with a starting price of 106,200 euros for the Sedan variantAudi Sport has officially unveiled the new Audi RS 5, marking the performance division's first foray into high-performance plug-in hybrid technology. Representing the pinnacle of the A5 model series, the electrified beast arrives in both Sedan and Avant body styles, delivering a massive 470 kW (639 PS) of system output.Technical innovation defines the new RS 5, which features a world-first quattro drivetrain equipped with Dynamic Torque Control. This electromechanical torque vectoring system at the rear transaxle recalculates optimal distribution every five milliseconds, allowing for unprecedented agility and precision. The powertrain combines a heavily revised 2.9-liter twin-turbo V6 — utilizing a modified Miller cycle for increased efficiency — with a 130 kW electric motor integrated into an eight-speed tiptronic transmission.The design is unmistakably aggressive, sitting nine centimeters wider than the standard A5 with flared fenders and 20-inch or optional 21-inch forged wheels. Signature RS details include a three-dimensional honeycomb Singleframe grille, darkened Matrix LED headlights with a checkered-flag DRL pattern, and matte oval tailpipes. Inside, the driver-centric cockpit is anchored by a slim, curved Audi MMI Panorama display featuring an 11.9-inch virtual cockpit and a 14.5-inch touch interface. To maintain performance, the 25.9 kWh battery is actively cooled to a precise 20 degrees Celsius when in \"RS sport\" or \"RS torque rear\" modes, ensuring maximum boost is always available.The Audi RS 5 is scheduled to open for orders in Europe during the first quarter of 2026, with initial deliveries expected to commence in Summer 2026.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "Imaging of atherosclerotic plaque, particularly via CT scan, has improved immensely over the past decade in its ability to quantify plaque and discern plaque composition, particularly with advances in machine learning approaches to analysis. Here, researchers demonstrate that plaque volume correlates with risk of severe cardiovascular events. The volume of softer, more fatty plaque also correlates with risk, much as one might expect. It is these less stable plaques that are more likely to fragment, leading to a downstream blockage. Imaging will become more important as cardiovascular therapies improve to point of being able to produce rapid stabilization or even regression of plaque, capabilities that do not currently exist. The best that can be done with the present standard of care, focused on lowering LDL [&#8230;]",

        "text": "In this image taken from video, Michael Black, a Rhode Island man who helped stop a shooter at a high school hockey game on Monday, holds up his injured hand during an interview with The Associated Press, Thursday, Feb. 19, 2026 in Spartanburg, S.C. (AP Photo)2026-02-19T16:31:55Z\n                                        PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Sitting in the stands at a hockey game, Michael Black heard what he thought was popping balloons before quickly realizing it was gunfire. As dozens of people rushed out of the Rhode Island arena, Black told his wife to “run, run” and then lunged toward the shooter’s handgun.Black managed to get his left hand caught in the chamber of Robert Dorgan’s gun, jamming it and then briefly attempted to hold Dorgan down. But Dorgan, a former bodybuilder, hoisted Black into the air before at least two other bystanders rushed over to subdue the shooter. One of them could be seen on video putting Dorgan into a choke hold.Dorgan fell to the ground, with Black on top of him. The shooter died from a self-inflicted gunshot after pulling out a second gun as the two locked eyes. Black never heard Dorgan say a word. “The first thought was the safety of my wife. And the second thought was, because the bullets were coming out, was to focus in on the gun,” Black said. “Get the gun and then subdue the shooter.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nPawtucket police have said the shooter behind the deadly ice rink tragedy on Monday was Robert Dorgan, who also went by Roberta Esposito and Roberta Dorgano.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nDorgan’s ex-wife Rhonda Dorgan and adult son Aidan Dorgan were killed in the shooting, and three others were injured: Rhonda Dorgan’s parents, Linda and Gerald Dorgan; and a family friend, Thomas Geruso, all of whom remained in critical condition Wednesday. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nPawtucket police say the group of “courageous citizens” who rushed to intervene in the attack “undoubtedly prevented further injury and increased the chances of survival for the injured.” Along with Black, Robert Robert Rattenni, and Ryan Cordeiro are being credited as subduing the suspect. Separately, Chris Librizzi and Glenn Narodowy, both retired Rhode Island firefighters and EMTs, and nurse Maryann Rattenni provided first aid in the immediate aftermath.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“I look at it as being fortunate, saddened tremendously in the loss, but fortunate that a small group of people could make a difference,” Black said in a zoom interview Thursday from South Carolina where he was on a college visit with his son. Authorities have not directly said that Dorgan was transgender and have said questions around Dorgan’s gender identity are not relevant to their investigation surrounding the case.However, court records from Dorgan’s past show that gender identity was at least one of the contributing factors to Dorgan’s wife filing for divorce in 2020 after nearly 30 years of marriage. Dorgan’s X account mention being transgender and sharing far-right ideologies.Black said Dorgan was walking down rows of seats determined to shoot more people. As he pinned the shooter’s head with his knee, Black said he noticed Dorgan had additional magazines holding “quite a few bullets.” With Dorgan dead, other bystanders rushed to provide treatment for the five people who had been shot and were lying between the bleachers. Blood was everywhere. Police arrived within in minutes and, Black with his injured hand, was escorted outside in the parking lot where he reunited with his wife.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“My wife saw me and she ran underneath the yellow tape, kind of grabbed me from behind, and we gave a big hug,” Black said. “She said, ‘I heard you helped with the shooter. And she says, what’s all the blood? I said, ’I got my hand caught in the gun.’ And then she said, ‘Honey, I don’t know whether I should be proud of you, but I’m pissed off at you for putting yourself in that situation.’”As he was sitting in the hospital getting treatment on his injured hand, Black recalled a nurse calling him a hero — a label that has repeatedly been applied to all three bystanders in recent days.“I said I don’t feel like I’m a hero right now,” Black said. “I looked up and I was feeling for the family.

        "text": "Alysa Liu of the United States competes during the women&#x27;s short program figure skating at the 2026 Winter Olympics, in Milan, Italy, Tuesday, Feb. 17, 2026. (AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko)2026-02-19T10:26:43Z\n                                        MILAN (AP) — Alysa Liu is left to bear the ambitions of the American figure skating team on Thursday night, when the last of the “Blade Angels” with a legitimate shot at the Olympic gold medal tries to catch Japanese teammates Ami Nakai and Kaori Sakamoto during the women’s free skate at the Milan Cortina Games.Nakai, Sakamoto and Mone Chiba give Japan the chance for the first-ever women’s podium sweep.Then there is Adeliia Petrosian, the young Russian sprite competing as a neutral athlete, and the only one of the contenders who has the ability to land a quad jump. She could shake up the entire competition with one big performance.Those are the key players as the final night of figure skating drama unfolds at the Winter Games.“Of course I want a medal. It would be very nice,” said Sakamoto, the bronze medalist from the 2022 Beijing Games, who trails Nakai by just a point in what is likely her final Olympics. “But I want to let everybody know what I’ve done over my career. I want people to know that there was a skater of this kind in Japan who had performed for a long period.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nIndeed, the Olympic gold medal is just about the only thing the 25-year-old Sakamoto has yet to win in her career.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nAt the opposite end of the longevity spectrum is Nakai, the 17-year-old inspired by the great Mao Asada. She will be the final skater on the ice after a brilliant performance Tuesday night, when she landed one of two triple axels in the entire women’s short program.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nChiba trails both of her Japanese teammates along with Liu, but the world bronze medalist is firmly in the mix.“Being in Italy, with the music ‘Romeo and Juliet,’ I hope to skate as well as possible,” Chiba said, “and see how things are.”Liu, who is two points out of first place, was the only skater to wedge herself among the Japanese trio.The 20-year-old from the San Francisco Bay area has been on a dream ride ever since her two-year retirement, which had allowed her to reprioritize the things in her life and rediscover her love for skating. Liu became the first American world champion since Kimmie Meissner in 2006 last year in Boston, and now she could end an even longer U.S. drought for women at the Olympics.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“The Star-Spangled Banner” has not played for a podium ceremony since Sarah Hughes triumphed at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games.“I don’t think about stuff like that,” said the carefree Liu, who finished sixth at the Beijing Games, shortly before walking away from the sport. “My goal is just to do my program and share my story.”Petrosian is the wildcard in the competition simply because she is so largely unknown.The 18-year-old from Moscow has been unable to compete on a global stage because Russia remains banned from international events following its invasion of Ukraine. The few glimpses that people have seen have come from domestic events, where scores are typically inflated, and where the competition is far different from what Petrosian is experiencing at the Olympics.Yet the latest pupil of controversial coach Eteri Tutberidze, Petrosian has proven in Milan that she could well become her nation’s next gold medalist, following in the footsteps of compatriots Adelina Sotnikova, Alina Zagitova and Anna Shcherbakova.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe last non-Russian to win the Olympic gold medal was South Korea’s Yuna Kim at the 2010 Vancouver Games.“At first I was worried, not about my skate, but about my (emotional) state. This was the most important start of my life,” Petrosian said following her short program Tuesday night. “I hope this will help me with my free skate.”___AP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                DAVE SKRETTA\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Skretta is a Kansas City-based sports writer for The Associated Press.

Allen’s estate has begun a formal sale process, honoring his directive to sell his sports holdings and direct the proceeds to philanthropyInvestment bank Allen &amp; Company and law firm Latham &amp; Watkins will run a multi‑year sale expected to fetch a record NFL franchise price while the team stays locked into Lumen Field and SeattleFresh off a second Lombardi and a parade that shut down downtown, the Seattle Seahawks are suddenly the hottest asset on the sports market. The Paul G. Allen Estate has kicked off a formal sale process for the reigning Super Bowl champions, an unprecedented move in the modern NFL and the climactic chapter in the late Microsoft co‑founder’s plan to liquidate his sports empire for charitable giving. Allen bought the franchise in 1997 for just under $200 million, keeping it from bolting to Southern California, and under Paul and Jody Allen the Seahawks evolved from league afterthought to perennial contender and two‑time Super Bowl winner.The estate has tapped Allen &amp; Company and Latham &amp; Watkins to handle the deal, a process the team says will stretch through the 2026 offseason before any buyer is vetted and ratified by at least 24 of 32 NFL owners. Public valuations peg the Seahawks in the $6.6 billion USD to $7 billion USD range, with some post‑title projections pushing the number toward eight digits, positioning the sale to eclipse the Washington Commanders and even challenge the $10 billion USD Los Angeles Lakers benchmark. With a long‑term lease at Lumen Field, sold‑out crowds since 2003 and the NFL’s next media‑rights cycle on deck, whoever steps in next inherits a ready‑made contender, a locked‑in city and one of the league’s most powerful platforms for both business and philanthropy.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

At the panel’s January meeting, some commissioners questioned the lead architect about the “immense” design and scale of the project even as they broadly endorsed the Republican president’s vision for a ballroom roughly twice the size of the White House itself. Trump’s decision in October to demolish the East Wing prompted a public outcry when it began without the independent reviews, congressional approval and public comment that are typical even for relatively minor modifications to historic buildings in Washington. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued in federal court to halt construction of the ballroom. A court decision in the case is pending.The project is scheduled for additional discussion at a March 5 meeting of the National Capital Planning Commission, which is led by one of Trump’s top White House aides. The commission has jurisdiction over construction and major renovations to government buildings in the region. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                DARLENE SUPERVILLE\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Superville covers the White House for The Associated Press, with a special emphasis on first ladies and first families.",

        "text": "Snow covers a road on an underpass along interstate 80 on Wednesday, Feb. 18, 2026 near Soda Springs, Calif. (AP Photo/Brooke Hess-Homeier)2026-02-19T06:59:50Z\n                                        TRUCKEE, Calif. (AP) — After days of increasingly brutal conditions in California’s Sierra Nevada, a group of 15 backcountry skiers set out for home. But as they left remote huts at thousands of feet of elevation and trekked back toward the trailhead, they were slammed by a treacherous avalanche that left eight dead and one missing. With avalanche warnings in effect through early Thursday, officials were still waiting for the powerful storm to clear so they could recover the bodies of the victims of Tuesday’s avalanche, the nation’s deadliest in nearly half a century. Officials have not yet released the names. The ski group involved has deep ties to the alpine recreation community in Lake Tahoe, including the elite Sugar Bowl Academy, which issued a statement late Wednesday mourning the loss of victims with “strong connections to Sugar Bowl, Donner Summit and the backcountry community.” \n    \n        \n    \n\nIt did not say how the skiers, said to range in age from 30 to 55, were connected to the school, which offers alpine and backcountry ski instruction and academics for young athletes. “We are an incredibly close and connected community,” Sugar Bowl Academy executive director Stephen McMahon was quoted as saying in the statement. “This tragedy has affected each and every one of us.” \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nFour in the group were guides from Blackbird Mountain Guides, which offers mountaineering and backcountry ski trips as well as safety courses across the West and internationally. One of them was among the six survivors. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe three-day tour, which began Sunday, was for intermediate to expert skiers, according to the company’s website.The tour company said in a statement Wednesday night that it has launched an investigation and paused field operations at least through the weekend while it prioritizes supporting the victims’ families. The company guides who led the group were trained or certified in backcountry skiing and were also instructors with the American Institute for Avalanche Research and Education.\n    \n        \n    \n\nWhile in the field, they “are in communication with senior guides at our base, to discuss conditions and routing based upon conditions,” founder Zeb Blais said in the statement.“We don’t have all the answers yet, and it may be some time before we do,” the company said. “In the meantime, please keep those impacted in your hearts.”Mayor Max Perrey of Marin County’s Mill Valley, a small city about 14 miles (22 kilometers) north of San Francisco, confirmed that some in the group were women from his city. He was not able to provide additional details but told The Associated Press via email that more information would be released later.The Sierra Avalanche Center issued an avalanche watch Sunday morning, and that was elevated to a warning by 5 a.m. Tuesday, indicating that avalanches were expected. It is not clear whether the guides would have known about the change before they began their return trek.Authorities described a harrowing scene as the survivors scoured the snow for the missing and waited six hours for help to arrive in blizzard conditions. They found three of the bodies, Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe skiers all had beacons that can send signals to rescuers, and at least one guide was able to send text messages. But it was not clear whether they were wearing avalanche bags, which are inflatable devices that can keep skiers near the surface, sheriff’s Capt. Russell “Rusty” Greene said.One of those rescued remained hospitalized Wednesday, Moon said. Three to 6 feet (91 centimeters to 1.8 meters) of snow has fallen in the area since Sunday. The area was also hit by subfreezing temperatures and gale force winds. The avalanche is the deadliest in the U.S. since 1981, when 11 climbers were killed on Mount Rainier in Washington state, and the second deadly avalanche near Castle Peak this year, after a snowmobiler was buried January. Each winter the slides kill 25 to 30 in the country, according to the National Avalanche Center. The area near Donner Summit, where the ski trip took place, is one of the snowiest places in the Western Hemisphere and until just a few years ago was closed to the public.

Russia’s war in Ukraine has starkly underlined the extent to which the continent’s energy security – and its future prosperity – is dependent on the transition away from fossil fuels. Lately, however, EU leaders’ environmental approach appears to be echoing the youthful St Augustine’s plea on chastity: make us greener, but not yet.The recent European Industry Summit in Antwerp made unusually big headlines thanks to Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s xenophobic outburst over immigration. But it was also notable for fierce attacks on one of the most important pillars of EU environmental policy. The bloc’s emissions trading system (ETS) – which makes polluters pay for the C02 they emit – has achieved dramatic results in driving down overall emissions since 2005 and encouraging green innovation. Worryingly, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, appeared to sympathise with demands from Sir Jim and other CEOs for a radical relaxation of the rules. Continue reading...",

        "title": "The U.S. and China Are Pursuing Different AI Futures",
        "text": "More money has been invested in AI than it took to land on the moon. Spending on the technology this year is projected to reach up to $700 billion, almost double last year’s spending. Part of the impetus for this frantic outlay is a conviction among investors and policymakers in the United States that it needs to “beat China.” Indeed, headlines have long cast AI development as a zero-sum rivalry between the U.S. and China, framing the technology’s advance as an arms race with a defined finish line. The narrative implies speed, symmetry, and a common objective.But a closer look at AI development in the two countries shows they’re not only not racing toward the same finish line: “The U.S. and China are running in very different lanes,” says Selina Xu, who leads China and AI policy research for Eric Schmidt, the tech investor, philanthropist and former Google chief, in New York City. “The U.S. is doubling down on scaling,” in pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) Xu says, “while for China it’s more about boosting economic productivity and real-world impact.”Lumping the U.S. and China onto a single AI scoreboard isn’t just inaccurate, it can impact policy and business decisions in a harmful way. “An arms race can become a self-fulfilling prophecy,” Xu says. “If companies and governments all embrace a ‘race to the bottom’ mentality, they will eschew necessary security and safety guardrails for the sake of being ahead. That increases the odds of AI-related crises.”Where’s the Real Finish Line?As machine learning advanced in the 2010s, prominent public figures such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk warned that it would be impossible to separate AI’s general-purpose potential from its military and economic implications, echoing Cold War–era frameworks for strategic competition. “An arms race is an easy way to think about this situation even if it’s not exactly right,” says Karson Elmgren, a China researcher at the Institute for AI Policy and Strategy, a think tank in San Francisco. Frontier labs, investors, and media benefit from simple, comparable progress metrics, like larger models, better benchmarks, and more computing power, so they favor and compound the arms race framing.Artificial general intelligence is the implied “finish line” if AI is an arms race. But one of the many problems with an AGI finish line is that by its very nature, a machine superintelligence would be smarter than humans and therefore impossible to control. “If superintelligence were to emerge in a particular country, there’s no guarantee that that country’s interests are going to win,” says Graham Webster, a China researcher at Stanford University, in Palo Alto, California.An AGI finish line also assumes the U.S. and China are both optimizing for this goal and putting the majority of their resources towards it. This isn’t the case, as the two countries have starkly different economic landscapes.When Is the Payoff?After decades of rapid growth, China is now facing a grimmer reality. “China has been suffering through an economic slowdown for a mixture of reasons, from real estate to credit to consumption and youth unemployment,” says Xu, adding that the country’s leaders have been “trying to figure out what is the next economic driver that can get China to sustain its growth.”Enter AI. Rather than pouring resources into speculative frontier models, Beijing has a pressing incentive to use the technology as a more immediate productivity engine. “In China we define AI as an enabler to improve existing industry, like healthcare, energy, or agriculture,” says AI policy researcher Liang Zheng, of Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. “The first priority is to use it to benefit ordinary people.”To that end, AI investment in China is focused on embedding the technology into manufacturing, logistics, energy, finance, and public services. “It’s a long-term structural change, and companies must invest more in machines, software, and digitalization,” Liang says. “Even very small and medium enterprises are exploring use of AI to improve their productivity.” China’s AI Plus initiative encourages using AI to boost efficiency. “Having a frontier technology doesn’t really move China towards an innovation-led developed economy,” says Kristy Loke, a fellow at MATS Research who focuses on China’s AI innovation and governance strategies. Instead, she says, “It’s really important to make sure that [these tools] are able to meet the demands of the Chinese economy, which are to industrialize faster, to do more smart manufacturing, to make sure they’re producing things in competitive processes.”Automakers have embraced intelligent robots in “dark factories” with minimal human intervention; as of 2024, China had around five times more factory robots in use than the U.S. “We used to use human eyes for quality control and it was very inefficient,” says Liang. Now, computer vision systems detect errors and software predicts equipment failures, pausing production and scheduling just-in-time maintenance. Agricultural models advise farmers on crop selection, planting schedules, and pest control.In healthcare, AI tools triage patients, interpret medical images, and assist diagnoses; Tsinghua is even piloting an AI “Agent Hospital” where physicians work alongside virtual clinical assistants. “In hospitals you used to have to wait a long time, but now you can use your agent to make a precise appointment,” Liang says. Many such applications use simpler “narrow AI” designed for specific tasks.AI is also increasingly embedded across industries in the U.S., but the focus tends toward service-oriented and data-driven applications, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to handle unstructured data and automate communication. For example, banks use LLM-based assistants to help users manage accounts, find transactions, and handle routine requests; LLMs help healthcare professionals extract information from medical notes and clinical documentation.“LLMs as a technology naturally fit the U.S. service-sector-based economy more so than the Chinese manufacturing economy,” Elmgren says.Competition and cooperationThe U.S. and China do compete more or less head-to-head in some AI-related areas, such as the underlying chips. The two have grappled to gain enough control over their supply chains to ensure national security, as recent tariff and export control fights have shown. “I think the main competitive element from a top level [for China] is to wriggle their way out of U.S. coercion over semiconductors. They want to have an independent capability to design, build, and package advanced semiconductors,” Webster says.Military applications of AI are also a significant arena of U.S.–China competition, with both governments aiming to speed decision-making, improve intelligence, and increase autonomy in weapons systems. The U.S. Department of Defense launched its AI Acceleration Strategy last month, and China has explicitly integrated AI into its military modernization strategy under its policy of military-civil fusion. “From the perspective of specific military systems, there are incremental advantages that one side or the other can gain,” Webster says.Despite China’s commitment to military and industrial applications, it has not yet picked an AI national champion. “After Deepseek in early 2025 the government could have easily said, ‘You guys are the winners, I’ll give you all the money, please build AGI,’ but they didn’t. They see being ‘close enough’ to the technological frontier as important, but putting all eggs in the AGI basket as a gamble,” Loke says.American companies are also still working with Chinese technology and workers, despite a slow uncoupling of the two economies. Though it may seem counterintuitive, more cooperation—and less emphasis on cutthroat competition—could yield better results for all. “For building more secure, trustworthy AI, you need both U.S. and Chinese labs and policymakers to talk to each other, to reach consensus on what’s off limits, then compete within those boundaries,” Xu says. “The arms race narrative also just misses the actual on-the-ground reality of companies co-opting each other’s approaches, the amount of research that gets exchanged in academic communities, the supply chains and talent that permeates across borders, and just how intertwined the two ecosystems are.”",
