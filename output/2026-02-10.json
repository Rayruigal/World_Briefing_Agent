        "title": "Hong Kong fire victims long for home as Lunar New Year stirs painful memories",
        "text": "Smoke rises after a fire broke out at Wang Fuk Court, a residential estate in the Tai Po district of Hong Kong&#x27;s New Territories, Nov. 26 2025. (AP Photo/Chan Long Hei, File)2026-02-09T23:00:35Z\n                                        HONG KONG (AP) — The deadliest fire in Hong Kong in decades last year left thousands of residents without some of their friends, family or the place they called home. More than two months later, the occupants of the Wang Fuk Court apartment complex are not only waiting for answers about what happened, but longing for a new place. Authorities are yet to unveil plans for long-term resettlement after surveying the residents’ preferences. The Lunar New Year on Feb. 17, meanwhile, is stirring recent memories of celebrating the festival in what is now a largely burnt complex.The massive blaze that engulfed seven apartment buildings killed 168 people on Nov. 26, 2025, shattering a close-knit community. Authorities blamed substandard scaffolding netting and foam boards from the buildings maintenance project for rapidly spreading the fire. Although some arrests were made, an independent committee is still investigating the cause.The Associated Press talked to four families who lived in the complex or lost their loved ones there. Here’s what they said:\n    \n        \n    \n\nNo place to call homeWhen flames devoured towers of the Wang Fuk Court complex, Pearl Chow, 87, fled her apartment with essential documents, like her title deed. Her grandson, Dorz Cheung, 33, rushed from his office to find her safe nearby, but the fire was raging.That night, Chow went to a friend’s home and didn’t sleep, while Cheung watched the flames for hours, crying while clutching his friend. They both miss old photos lost in their home in Tai Po, a suburban district in the city’s north. Now they are separated into two temporary housing units on separate floors, each around 100 square feet (9.2 square meters). Chow was satisfied, but Cheung couldn’t call it home.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n“Only permanent residence is called home. That’s the root,” he said.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nChow still regularly returns to Tai Po for church and grocery shopping, despite the hourlong journey. They want to be resettled in Tai Po, where they lived for decades, in a unit about the same size as their old apartment. \n    \n        \n    \n\n“I am an elderly person. When they finish building, I may have gone to my heavenly home,” she said with a laugh. Data from the 2021 population census showed over one-third of some 4,600 residents in the complex were aged 65 or above. While the government proposed measures to combat bid-rigging in building maintenance and enhance fire safety in January, Cheung feels their resettlement hasn’t been addressed. He said he lost his sense of security with the authorities after the blaze. “We can only wait, be tossed around like a ball,” he said.A temporary refuge Kit Chan, 74, lived in her 460-square-foot (43-square-meter) apartment for over 40 years and raised her children with her husband in the complex, where neighbors helped look after each other’s children. Chan had planned to spend the rest of her life there, but the blaze forced the couple into a studio unit at a youth hostel half the size of their apartment. Weeks ago, they heard some fire victims were asked to move out, and that distressed her. “It’s like being unable to get by in my final years,” she said. \n    \n        \n    \n\nShe hasn’t been asked to leave, but is uncertain how long they can stay. Chan initially wanted to be resettled in a new home built on the fire site, but the government estimates rebuilding will take about a decade — too long for her to wait. She can compromise on a similar-sized apartment in another district with good transport.Her husband, Keung Mak, 78, hopes they can return to their old home just to have a look. It has memories like their family and wedding photos. “Many people hope they can at least see how badly it was burned,” Mak said.Weighing time against placeDuring past Lunar New Year celebrations, Isaac Tam’s family used to visit neighbors on their floor with gifts. Now, the familiar faces he has known for years are scattered across the city. The loss of their two apartments in the fire was heartbreaking. His parents cried, and his 92-year-old grandfather grew thinner. But Tam, 23, said at least all his family members were alive.Last weekend, they were preparing to move into temporary homes, smaller than their old apartments and farther from the city center. They shelled out money to renovate them. \n    \n        \n    \n\nWhile he said the government’s handling is not as bad as some say, he still worries about his grandfather adjusting to a new district with temporary housing. Back in Tai Po, the grandfather used to have a morning dim sum routine with his friends. As they await the government’s resettlement plans, they have been weighing apartments in another district that will be ready sooner than units in Tai Po, which he prefers because he grew up there. Time is their priority, given the grandfather’s age, Tam said. “I also fear he can’t wait until we secure an apartment of about 400 square feet (about 37 square meters),” he said, regardless of the district. \n    \n        \n    \n\nGrieving for mother and hanging on to memories Phyllis Lo’s mother called her after seeing thick smoke outside her door when the blaze started. On the call, knowing she might not survive, her 74-year-old mother asked Lo, 48, and her brother to live well. Lo immediately rushed to her childhood home and called again minutes later. No one answered. The next morning, police told her they found her mother’s body. After learning that a mix of issues including substandard materials were used in the building maintenance project and failed fire alarms, Lo wondered if the tragedy could have been avoided if each government department had done a better job. While she couldn’t determine who should bear responsibility, she blamed herself for not monitoring the project for her mother more closely. What bothers her most is the lack of transparency — when she can see her burnt apartment, how authorities will use the $589 million relief fund. She hopes to get updates from the nine-month investigation. She wants her childhood home rebuilt at the fire site, but considers the proposed timeline of about a decade unreasonably long.As the Lunar New Year neared, Lo made turnip cakes — a tradition she inherited from her mother. “Maybe she is still everywhere and still seeing us now. I really want to be with her,” she said in tears. Rebuilding community is challenging In an emailed reply to The Associated Press’ questions, the government said it attached great importance to the residents’ long-term accommodation arrangements and had already received survey replies from over 95% of the homeowners. It did not give a timeline but said its task force is analyzing their preferences and that the government will announce the plans after finalizing them. Jack Rozdilsky, professor of disaster and emergency management at York University in Canada, said the city is moving to a disaster recovery phase and noted that concrete plans for continuous mental health and trauma coping aid play a key role in long-term success for any resettlement measure. Rozdilsky saw the community survey on resettlement as a good sign because a one-size-fits-all proposal will not satisfy the households. While rebuilding living spaces is complicated, he said, reconstructing a community is much harder. He said understanding what promoted community at the housing complex before the fire and incorporating those features — be it a bus stop or a gathering point in a park — would help. “Very small things matter,” he said. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                KANIS LEUNG\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Leung covers Hong Kong, Macao and mainland China for The Associated Press.

        "title": "Democrats and White House trade offers as shutdown of Homeland Security looms",
        "text": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., center, speaks during a news conference as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. listens, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Feb. 4, 2026. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)2026-02-09T23:42:47Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats have begun tentative talks with the White House on their demands for “dramatic” new restrictions on President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, trading offers just days before funding for the Department of Homeland Security is set to expire. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday that Democrats had sent the White House their list of demands for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal law enforcement agencies. The White House said it had responded with a counterproposal. No details were immediately available. Time is running short, with another partial government shutdown threatening to begin Saturday. Among the Democrats’ demands are a requirement for judicial warrants, better identification of DHS officers, new use-of-force standards and a stop to racial profiling. They say such changes are necessary after two protesters were fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis last month.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“Republicans, the clock is ticking,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “We have sent you our proposals and they are exceedingly reasonable.” There were some small signs of progress. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Monday there has been a “good back and forth” between the sides on substantive issues and Republicans would send a counterproposal “soon.” \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nStill, it was unclear if the two sides could find agreement on the charged issue of immigration enforcement — and as rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties were skeptical about finding common ground.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nMany Republicans have balked at the Democrats’ requests and some have demands of their own, including the addition of legislation that would require proof of citizenship before Americans register to vote and restrictions on cities that they say do not do enough to crack down on illegal immigration. And Democrats who are furious about ICE’s aggressive crackdown have said they won’t vote for another penny of Homeland Security funding until enforcement is radically scaled back. “Dramatic changes are needed at the Department of Homeland Security before a DHS funding bill moves forward,” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Monday. “Period. Full stop.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nTrump deals with Democrats Congress is trying to renegotiate the DHS spending bill after President Donald Trump agreed to a Democratic request that it be separated out from a larger spending measure that became law last week. That package extended Homeland Security funding at current levels only through Feb. 13, creating a brief window for action as the two parties discuss new restrictions on ICE and other federal officers. The funding issue came to a head after ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Jan. 24, and some Republicans suggested that new restrictions were necessary. Renee Good was shot by ICE agents on Jan. 7. While he agreed to separate the funding, Trump has not publicly responded to the Democrats’ specific demands, and it is uncertain whether he would agree to any of them. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said late last week that the Trump administration is willing to discuss some items on the Democrats’ list, but “others don’t seem like they are grounded in any common sense, and they are nonstarters for this administration.” \n    \n        \n    \n\nDemocratic demands Schumer and Jeffries have said they want immigration officers to remove their masks, to show identification and to better coordinate with local authorities. They have also demanded a stricter use-of-force policy for the federal officers, legal safeguards at detention centers and a prohibition on tracking protesters with body-worn cameras.The Democrats say Congress should end indiscriminate arrests, “improve warrant procedures and standards,” ensure the law is clear that officers cannot enter private property without a judicial warrant and require that before a person can be detained, it’s verified that the person is not a U.S. citizen.Republicans have said they support the requirement for DHS officers to have body-worn cameras — language that was in the original DHS bill — but have balked at many of the other Democratic asks. \n    \n        \n    \n\n“Taking the masks off ICE officers and agents, the reason we can’t do that is that it would subject them to great harm, their families at great risk because people are doxing them and targeting them,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Monday. “We’ve got to talk about things that are reasonable and achievable.” Tennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty said on “Fox News Sunday” that Democrats are ”trying to motivate a radical left base.” “The left has gone completely overboard, and they’re threatening the safety and security of our agents so they cannot do their job,” Hagerty said. \n    \n        \n    \n\nConsequences of a shutdown In addition to ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the homeland security bill includes funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration. If DHS shuts down, Thune said last week, “there’s a very good chance we could see more travel problems” similar to the 43-day government closure last year.Lawmakers in both parties have suggested they could separate out funding for ICE and Border Patrol and pass the rest of it by Friday. But Thune has been cool to that idea, saying instead that Congress should pass another short-term extension for all of DHS while they negotiate the possible new restrictions. Many Democrats are unlikely to vote for another extension. But Republicans could potentially win enough votes in both chambers from Democrats if they feel hopeful about negotiations. “The ball is in the Republicans’ court,” Jeffries said Monday. ___Associated Press writers Joey Cappelletti and Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n            \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                SEUNG MIN KIM\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Kim covers the White House for The Associated Press.

        "title": "When conflict meets competition: Trump’s immigration agenda roils opening days of Winter Olympics",
        "text": "President Donald Trump walks on the South Lawn upon his arrival to the White House, Monday, Feb. 9, 2026, in Washington. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)2026-02-09T21:47:47Z\n                                        LIVIGNO, Italy (AP) — As the Winter Olympics opened in Milan, Vice President JD Vance hailed the competition as “one of the few things that unites the entire country.”That unity didn’t last long.The early days of the Milan Cortina Games have been roiled by the tumultuous political debate in the U.S. American athletes have faced persistent questions about President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration enforcement agenda and their comfort in representing a country whose policies are increasingly controversial on the world stage.“There’s obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of and I think a lot of people aren’t,” American freestyle skier Hunter Hess said as he spoke of the “mixed emotions” of representing the U.S. “If it aligns with my moral values, I feel like I’m representing it. Just because I’m wearing the flag doesn’t mean I represent everything that’s going on in the U.S.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nThat prompted a fast response from Trump, who said on social media that Hess was a “real loser” who “shouldn’t have tried out for the team.”“Very hard to root for someone like this,” the president added.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe criticism of an American athlete from a U.S. president was a sharp departure from the unifying, apolitical tones the White House typically strikes during the Olympics, highlighting how the tension over the enforcement of Trump’s immigration policies has now bled into athletic competition. Other leading conservative voices, ranging from podcaster Megyn Kelly to a Republican candidate for governor in Florida, added to the critique of Hess, with some calling for him to be taken off the U.S. team. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nBy Monday, other top athletes who have previously found themselves in political controversy were rallying to Hess’ defense. “In moments like these, it is really important for us to unite and kind of stand up for one another for all that’s going on,” said Chloe Kim, the two-time Olympic gold medalist whose parents are South Korean immigrants and who has faced racism throughout her career for her Asian heritage. \n    \n        \n    \n\nAfter her silver-medal win in slopestyle, Eileen Gu, who was born in San Francisco and competes for China, said she had been in touch with Hess, who told her she was one of the few people who could relate to what he’s going through.“As someone who’s been caught in the crossfire before, I feel sorry for the athletes,” said Gu, whose decision to compete for China drew sharp critiques. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe Olympics are never walled off from politicsThe Olympics are never walled off from the political and cultural debates. The raised fists of Tommie Smith and John Carlos during the 1968 Olympics remain one of the most powerful and enduring images of protest and resistance to racial injustice in the U.S. Since then, political commentary from athletes has become more commonplace, aided by social media platforms that allow competitors to share their real-time thoughts on everything from food and nutrition to news of the day. The comments from athletes in Italy are notable, however, because they’re coming at the biggest global sporting event to occur since federal agents killed two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis last month, reigniting a debate in the U.S. and abroad over Trump’s hard-line immigration measures. Chris Lillis, another American freestyle skier, said he felt “heartbroken about what’s happening in the United States.”“As a country, we need to focus on respecting everybody’s rights and making sure that we’re treating our citizens as well as anybody with love and respect,” he said. “I hope that when people look at athletes competing in the Olympics, they realize that that’s the America that we’re trying to represent.”Skiing star Mikaela Shiffrin quoted Nelson Mandela as she acknowledged “a lot of hardship in the world globally, and there’s a lot of heartbreak, there’s a lot of violence.”“It can be tough to reconcile that when you’re also competing for medals in an Olympic event,” she said. “I’m really hoping to show up and represent my own values, values of inclusivity, values of diversity and kindness and sharing, tenacity, work ethic, showing up with my team every single day.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nFor the most part, athletes are largely engaging in political conversation during news conferences when they’re specifically asked to respond to news events. At one such press event, American figure skater Amber Glenn, an outspoken LGBTQ+ rights activist, noted that the queer community is going through a “hard time” under Trump. She later said she would step back from social media after receiving threats on the platform. Political controversy can put athletes at an uneasy intersection as they weigh whether to use their platforms to take a stance or avoid anything that might upset their fans or sponsors. During last month’s Australian Open tennis tournament, American Amanda Anisimova said questions about U.S. politics were not “relevant.” Another American player, Taylor Fritz, said he felt that “whatever I say here is going to get put in a headline and it’s going to get taken out of context.”\n    \n        \n    \n\n“So I’d really rather not do something that’s going to cause a big distraction for me in the middle of the tournament,” he said.Back at the Olympics, U.S. speedskater Casey Dawson, said “we definitely know the whole situation going on in the USA” while noting that “politics don’t apply to us” at the Games. “We’re here to skate,” said Dawson, who finished eighth in the men’s 5,000 meters on Sunday with Vance and his family in the stands. “We’re here to skate. We’re here to perform.”___Sloan reported from Washington.

        "text": "Liam Conejo Ramos, 5, is detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers after arriving home from preschool, Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2026, in a Minneapolis suburb. (Ali Daniels via AP)2026-02-09T15:55:06Z\n                                        MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Federal authorities have denied attempting to expedite an end to asylum claims by the family of a 5-year-old boy who was detained with his father during the immigration crackdown that has shaken the Minneapolis area. Images of Liam Conejo Ramos wearing a bunny hat and Spider-Man backpack surrounded by immigration officers stirred outrage over the crackdown.Danielle Molliver, a lawyer for the boy and his father, told the New York Times that the government was attempting to speed up the deportation proceedings, calling the actions “extraordinary” and possibly “retaliatory.”The government denied that.“These are regular removal proceedings. They are not in expedited removal,” Department of Homeland Security official Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement, adding “there is nothing retaliatory about enforcing the nation’s immigration laws.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nMolliver told the Times that an immigration judge, during a closed Friday hearing, gave her additional time to argue the family’s case.The boy and his father, Adrian Conejo Arias, who originally is from Ecuador, were detained in a Minneapolis suburb on Jan. 20. They were taken to a detention facility in Dilley, Texas.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThey were released following a judge’s order and returned to Minnesota on Feb. 1.Neighbors and school officials have accused federal immigration officers of using the preschooler as “bait” by telling him to knock on the door to his house so that his mother would come outside. DHS has called that description of events an “abject lie.” It said the father fled on foot and left the boy in a running vehicle in their driveway.The government said the boy’s father entered the U.S. illegally from Ecuador in December 2024. The family’s lawyer said he has an asylum claim pending that allows him to stay in the U.S.",

William Timmons, R-S.C., speaks to reporters after a closed-circuit deposition with Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend and confidante of sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, at the Capitol in Washington, Monday, Feb. 9, 2026. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)2026-02-09T15:35:15Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein, declined to answer questions from House lawmakers in a deposition Monday, but indicated that if President Donald Trump ended her prison sentence, she was willing to testify that neither he nor former President Bill Clinton had done anything wrong in their relationships with Epstein.The House Oversight Committee had wanted Maxwell to answer questions during a video call to the federal prison camp in Texas where she’s serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, but she invoked her Fifth Amendment rights to avoid answering questions that would be self-incriminating. She’s come under new scrutiny as lawmakers try to investigate how Epstein, a well-connected financier, was able to sexually abuse underage girls for years.Amid a reckoning over Epstein’s abuse that has spilled into nations around the globe, lawmakers are searching for anyone who was connected to Epstein and may have facilitated his abuse. So far, the revelations have shown how both Trump and Clinton spent time with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s, but they have not been credibly accused of wrongdoing.\n    \n        \n    \n\nDuring the closed-door deposition Monday, an attorney for Maxwell told lawmakers that if Trump granted her clemency, she would be willing to testify that neither Trump nor Clinton were culpable for wrongdoing in their relationships with Epstein, according to both Democratic and Republican lawmakers who exited the closed-door meeting.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nDemocrats said that was a brazen effort by Maxwell to have Trump end her prison sentence.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“It’s very clear she’s campaigning for clemency,” said Rep. Melanie Stansbury, a New Mexico Democrat.Another Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, described Maxwell’s demeanor during the short video call as “robotic” and “unrepentant.”Trump has not ruled out granting Maxwell clemency, but Republican pushback to that notion quickly rose after Maxwell made the appeal.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“NO CLEMENCY. You comply or face punishment,” Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, wrote on social media. “You deserve JUSTICE for what you did you monster.”Maxwell has been seeking to have her conviction overturned, arguing that she was wrongfully convicted. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal last year, but in December she requested that a federal judge in New York consider what her attorneys describe as “substantial new evidence” that her trial was spoiled by constitutional violations.Maxwell’s attorney cited that petition as he told lawmakers she would invoke her Fifth Amendment rights.The Republican chair of the committee, Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, told reporters that it was “very disappointing” that Maxwell declined to participate in the deposition.Family members of the late Virginia Giuffre, one of the most outspoken victims of Epstein, also released a letter to Maxwell making it clear they did not consider her “a bystander” to Epstein’s abuse. “You were a central, deliberate actor in a system built to find children, isolate them, groom them, and deliver them to abuse,” Sky and Amanda Roberts wrote in the letter addressed to Maxwell.\n    \n        \n    \n\nMaxwell was moved from a federal prison in Florida to a low-security prison camp in Texas last summer after she participated in two-days of interviews with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.Comer had also subpoenaed her at the time, but her attorneys have consistently told the committee that she wouldn’t answer questions. However, Comer came under pressure to hold the deposition as he pressed for the committee to enforce subpoenas on Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. After Comer threatened them with contempt of Congress charges, they both agreed to sit for depositions later this month.Comer has been haggling with the Clintons over whether that testimony should be held in a public hearing, but Comer reiterated Monday that he would insist on holding closed-door depositions and later releasing transcripts and video.Meanwhile, several lawmakers also planned on Monday to look through unredacted versions of the files on Epstein that the Department of Justice has released to comply with a law passed by Congress last year.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                STEPHEN GROVES\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Groves covers Congress for The Associated Press.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto",

        "title": "NYC nurses reach a deal to end a strike at 2 major hospitals while walkout continues at another",
        "text": "Striking nurses and supporters demonstrate outside NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in New York, Thursday, Jan. 22, 2026. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)2026-02-09T16:04:36Z\n                                        NEW YORK (AP) — Nurses and two major hospital systems in New York City have reached a deal to end a nearly monthlong strike over staffing levels, workplace safety, health insurance and other issues.The tentative agreement announced Monday by the union representing nurses involves the Montefiore and Mount Sinai hospital systems. Nurses remain on strike at NewYork Presbyterian. The walkout began Jan. 12, prompting the hospitals to scramble to hire legions of temporary nurses to fill in during a demanding flu season. The union said members at Montefiore and Mount Sinai hospitals will vote on whether to ratify the contracts and return to work this week. The three-year deal affects roughly 10,500 of the some 15,000 nurses on strike at some of the city’s biggest private, nonprofit hospitals, with thousands of beds among them.“For four weeks, nearly 15,000 NYSNA members held the line in the cold and in the snow for safe patient care,” Nancy Hagans, president of the New York State Nurses Association, said in a statement. “Now, nurses at Montefiore and Mount Sinai systems are heading back to the bedside with our heads held high.” \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe nurses union said the agreement calls for a 12% pay raise over three years as well as maintain nurses’ health benefits with no additional out-of-pocket costs. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe pact also includes new protections against workplace violence, including specific protections for transgender and immigrant nurses and patients, as well as safeguards against artificial intelligence, the union said.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nNurses at Montefiore, Mount Sinai, and Mount Sinai Morningside and West will vote to ratify their contracts starting today, the union said.If the tentative contract agreements are ratified, nurses will return to work on Saturday. A Montefiore spokesperson declined to comment other than to say its nurses are expected to vote Wednesday on the pact.\n    \n        \n    \n\nSpokespeople for the other two hospital systems didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment. The affected hospitals have insisted their operations are running smoothly during the walkout, with organ transplants, cardiac surgeries and other complex procedures largely uninterrupted. Many of the medical centers, however, canceled scheduled surgeries, transferred some patients and discharged others ahead of the strike.The striking nurses priorities vary by hospital, but staffing has generally been a central issue. Nurses said they have been overloaded, and that the hospitals wouldn’t commit to staffing levels that are manageable for nurses and safe for patients.The hospitals maintain they’ve filled and even added nursing jobs over the last three years, digging out of a pandemic-era staffing crisis.The hospitals and nurses also have been at odds over benefits, and the union sought workplace security upgrades and restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence.Hospital staffers’ longstanding security concerns flared into public view when a gunman entered Mount Sinai in November and a man holed up in a Brooklyn hospital with a sharp object last month. Police killed both men.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe hospitals said the union’s demands were exorbitant. They say unionized nurses’ salaries already average $162,000 to $165,000 a year, not including benefits.The nurses countered that the medical centers’ top executives make millions of dollars a year, an argument underscored by New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and other politicians who have visited the picket lines over the weeks.Not every hospital in the three health care systems was affected by the strike. Nor were any city-run public hospitals. Other private hospitals reached last-minute deals with the union. Nurses staged a three-day strike in 2023 in the Mount Sinai and Montefiore systems. They ultimately inked contracts that raised pay 19% over three years and sought to make staffing improvements enforceable by allowing for extra pay if nurses worked short-handed.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                PHILIP MARCELO\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Marcelo is a general assignment reporter in the NYC bureau.

And the circumstances that weren’t shown on the news this morning or on TV last night because is what would have happened if protesters breached police lines ...It would have dangerous … as difficult as the scenes were to watch, it would have been infinitely worse if NSW police didn’t do their job last night.I think the - the protest organisers, when both the police and the courts said to them, yes, you can protest, but you can either do it in a stationary way here in Town Hall, if you want to march, you can march through a different part of the city, should have heeded that advice.But of course, some of the videos that we’ve seen have been very concerning.

        "title": "Navy leader wants to move faster and leaner instead of turning to aircraft carriers in crisis",
        "text": "U.S. Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Daryl Caudle, talks to selected journalists during his visit in Tokyo, Nov. 17, 2025. (AP Photo/Mari Yamaguchi, File)2026-02-09T23:32:05Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Navy’s top uniformed officer wants to convince commanders to use smaller, newer assets for missions instead of consistently turning to huge aircraft carriers — as seen now in the American military buildups off Venezuela and Iran.Adm. Daryl Caudle’s vision — what he calls his “ Fighting Instructions ” — calls for the Navy to deploy more tailored groups of ships and equipment that would offer the sea service more flexibility to respond to crises as they develop.The new strategy comes as the Trump administration has moved aircraft carriers and other ships to regions around the world as concerns have cropped up, often disrupting standing deployment plans, scrambling ships to sail thousands of miles and putting increasing strain on vessels and equipment that are already facing mounting maintenance issues.The world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, was redirected late last year from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean Sea, where the crew ultimately supported last month’s operation to capture then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. And two weeks ago, the USS Abraham Lincoln arrived in the Middle East as tensions with Iran rise, having been pulled from the South China Sea.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIn a recent interview with The Associated Press before the document’s rollout, Caudle said his strategy would make the Navy’s presence in regions like the Caribbean much leaner and better tailored to meet actual threats.Caudle said he’s already spoken with the commander of U.S. Southern Command, which encompasses the Caribbean and Venezuela, “and we’re in negotiation on what his problem set is — I want to be able to convey that I can meet that with a tailored package there.”\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nAdmiral sees a smaller contingent in the Caribbean in the futureSpeaking broadly, Caudle said he envisions the mission in the Caribbean focusing more on interdictions and keeping an eye on merchant shipping.The U.S. military has already seized multiple suspicious and falsely flagged tankers connected with Venezuela that were part of a global shadow fleet of merchant vessels that help governments evade sanctions.“That doesn’t really require a carrier strike group to do that,” Caudle said, adding that he believes the mission could be done with some smaller littoral combat ships, Navy helicopters and close coordination with the Coast Guard.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe Navy has had 11 ships, including the Ford and several amphibious assault ships with thousands of Marines, in South American waters for months. It is a major shift for a region that has historically seen deployments of one or two smaller Navy ships.“I don’t want a lot of destroyers there driving around just to actually operate the radar to get awareness on motor vessels and other tankers coming out of port,” Caudle said. “It’s really not a well-suited match for that mission.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nTurning to drones or robotic systemsTo compensate, Caudle envisions leaning more heavily on drones or other robotic systems to offer military commanders the same capabilities but with less investment from Navy ships. He acknowledges this will not be an easy sell.Caudle said even if a commander knows about a new capability, the staff “may not know how to ask for that, integrate it, and know how to employ it in an effective way to bring this new niche capability to bear.”“That requires a bit of an education campaign here,” he later added.President Donald Trump has favored large and bold responses from the Navy and has leaned heavily toward displays of firepower.\n    \n        \n    \n\nTrump has referred to aircraft carriers and their accompanying destroyers as armadas and flotillas. He also revived the historic battleship title for a planned type of ship that would sport hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns and high-powered lasers.If built, the proposed “Trump-class battleship” would be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships, though the Navy has not only struggled to field some of the technologies that Trump says will be aboard but it has had challenges building even smaller, less sophisticated ships on time and on budget.\n    \n        \n    \n\nGiven this trend, Caudle said if the Lincoln’s recent redeployment to the Middle East were to happen under his new plan, he would talk with the Indo-Pacific commander about how to compensate for the loss.“So, as Abraham Lincoln comes out, I’ve got a three ship (group) that’s going to compensate for that,” Caudle suggested as an example.Caudle argues that his vision already is in place and working in Europe and North America “for the last four or five years.”He said this could apply soon in the Bering Strait, which separates Russia and Alaska, noting that “the importance of the Arctic continues to get more and more prevalent” as China, Russia and the U.S. prioritize the region. Trump has cited the threat from China and Russia in his demands to take over Greenland, the Arctic island overseen by NATO ally Denmark.Caudle said he knows he needs to offer the commanders in that region “more solutions” and his “tailored force packages would be a way to get after that.”",

        "text": "Lit candles next to a sign from neighbors supporting the Guthrie family outside of Nancy Guthrie’s house in the early morning hours of Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026 in Tucson, Ariz. (AP Photo/Ty ONeil)2026-02-09T15:50:14Z\n                                        TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Authorities investigating the apparent kidnapping of Nancy Guthrie returned to her Arizona neighborhood several times over the weekend, ahead of a Monday evening deadline set by her purported abductors who sent ransom notes demanding money for her return.The investigation into what happened to the mother of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie entered a second week with still no word on whether the 84-year-old is still alive. Savannah Guthrie said over the weekend that family was prepared to pay for her mother’s return. “We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her,” she said in a video posted Saturday. “This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.”The mysterious disappearance and search has riveted the U.S. — from President Donald Trump who spoke with Samantha Guthrie last week to the online sleuths who’ve flooded social media with tips, theories and rumors.\n    \n        \n    \n\nOutside Nancy Guthrie’s home on Monday, neighbors strolled by on their morning jogs and walks while a county sheriff’s deputy remained stationed out front.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nDetectives and agents carried out follow-up work at multiple locations over the weekend as part of the investigation, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said Sunday. “Investigators have not identified any suspects, persons of interest, or vehicles connected to this case,” the department said. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nInvestigators believe Nancy Guthrie was taken against her will from her home just outside Tucson. She was last seen on Jan. 31 and reported missing the next day after not attending church services. DNA tests showed blood on Guthrie’s front porch was a match to her, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has said.Multiple press outlets have received alleged ransom letters during the past week.

The exhibition creates a cross-cultural dialogue by blending diverse styles influenced by outsider art, rural aesthetics and Americana. Collectively, the works form a contemporary grand tour centered on themes of self‑discovery and revelation, while confronting social realities through raw depictions of suburban and everyday life. The exhibition’s visual language is deliberately unfiltered, offering a direct reflection on the tensions and complexities of contemporary society.The featured artists share a conceptual foundation rooted in themes of nostalgia, \"on-the-road\" iconography and the tension between emptiness and hope. Notable artworks include Jordan Sullivan’s acrylic on canvas work \"Lazarus\" and Robert Martin’s acrylic on panel piece \"Hellfire, deliver to Us.\" Sullivan contributes raw, narrative-driven scenes, Martin offers detailed and pragmatic compositions; meanwhile, Rochester provides a trend-aware sensibility, and RUMINZ presents stylized, textured works.Available for view at GR Gallery from February 20 - March 21, 2026, Purgatory invites visitors into a suspended emotional state where the intensity of reality meets the absurdity of the scenes depicted, capturing fragments of human existence marked by suffering and a desire for redemption.GR Gallery116 Chambers St,New York, NY 10007,United StatesClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "United States&#x27; Lindsey Vonn, right, poses for photographs with her father Alan Kildow at the end of an alpine ski, women&#x27;s World Cup downhill race, in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Italy, Friday, Jan. 16, 2015. (AP Photo/Andrew Dampf, File)2026-02-09T18:47:24Z\n                                        CORTINA D’AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Lindsey Vonn’s father said Monday that the American superstar will no longer race if he has any influence over her decision and that she will not return to the Winter Olympics after breaking her leg in the downhill over the weekend.“She’s 41 years old and this is the end of her career,” Alan Kildow said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. “There will be no more ski races for Lindsey Vonn, as long as I have anything to say about it.”Kildow and the rest of Vonn’s family — a brother and two sisters, too — have been with Vonn while she is being treated at a hospital in Treviso following her fall and helicopter evacuation from the course in Cortina on Sunday.The hospital late Sunday released a statement saying Vonn had undergone surgery on her left leg and the U.S. Ski Team said she was in stable condition. There have not been other updates since. \n    \n        \n    \n\nKildow declined to comment on details of Vonn’s injuries, but he did address how she was doing emotionally.“She’s a very strong individual,” Kildow said. “She knows physical pain and she understands the circumstances that she finds herself in. And she’s able to handle it. Better than I expected. She’s a very, very strong person. And so I think she’s handling it real well.”\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nKildow — a former ski racer himself who taught his daughter to race — said he slept in his daughter’s hospital room overnight.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“She has somebody with her — or multiple people with her — at all times,” Kildow said. “We’ll have people here as long as she’s here.”Kildow and the rest of Vonn’s family watched the crash from the finish area with all of the other spectators.“First, the shock and the horror of the whole thing, seeing a crash like that,” Kildow said of what he felt watching the scene unfold. “It can be dramatic and traumatic. You’re just horrified at what those kinds of impacts have.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“You can go into a shock an emotional psychological shock,” he added. “Because it’s difficult to just accept what’s happened. But she’s well cared for. … And the USOC and the U.S. Ski team have a very, very top-notch doctor with her and she is being very well cared for here in Italy.”Vonn raced the downhill despite tearing the ACL in her left knee nine days earlier in another crash.“What happened to her had nothing to do with the ACL issue on her left leg. Nothing,” Kildow said. “She had demonstrated that she was able to function at a very high level with the two downhill training runs. … And she had been cleared by high level physicians to ski.”Kildow said the crash was less a result of Vonn’s knee injury than the way she pushed the limits of her racing line to the point where she clipped a gate early in her run and got knocked out of control.“There are times sometimes in any race, but especially in downhill, where you have to take a little speed off,” he said. “You can give yourself a little bit more leeway on the line so you don’t put yourself in a questionable position.”Vonn, who holds the record of 12 World Cup victories in Cortina, returned to the circuit last season after nearly six years of retirement and after a partial titanium replacement surgery in her right knee. She won two downhills and finished on the podium in seven of the eight World Cup races that she finished this season — and came fourth in the other one.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“She won 84 World Cup races. And not many people do that,” Kildow said, referring to Vonn’s victory total, which place her second on the all-time women’s list behind teammate Mikaela Shiffrin’s record 108 wins.“And there’s a hell of a lot of the difference between a speed race, a downhill especially, and a slalom,” Kildow added.Vonn will not return to the Olympics to cheer on teammates or for anything else, Kildow said.“No, she’s not that in kind of situation,” he said. “She will be going home at an appropriate point in time.”___AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                ANDREW DAMPF\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Dampf has been a Rome-based sports writer at The AP for over 20 years, covering soccer, tennis, Alpine skiing and many other events in Italy and beyond, including five soccer World Cups.

That comes after Arizona — one of two unbeaten teams left in Division I — won at rival Arizona State, then returned home to beat Oklahoma State by 37 points.Michigan remained at No. 2, marking the sixth time in Arizona’s current reign that the Wolverines sat right behind them. Houston (21-2) moved up five spots to No. 3 after wins against UCF and at BYU, returning Kelvin Sampson’s Cougars inside the top 5 after a November stint that included a week at No. 1.\n    \n        \n    \n\nDuke, Iowa State, UConn, Nebraska, Illinois, Kansas and Michigan State rounded out the top 10.Kentucky was the week’s lone addition at No. 25, returning to the poll for the first time since early December in a season that started with a No. 9 preseason ranking. The Wildcats have won eight of nine, with Saturday’s home win against Tennessee knocking the Volunteers out of the poll.___Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

        "text": "SummaryA string of early medal ceremonies at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics has been overshadowed by reports that medals are breaking or detaching from their ribbons within hoursU.S. stars Breezy Johnson and Alysa Liu, German biathlete Justus Strelow, Swedish skier Ebba Andersson and others have all shown damage ranging from broken clasps to chipped and cracked metalGames organisers, led by chief games operations officer Andrea Francisi, say they are fully aware of the situation and have launched an investigation into potential design or construction flawsAcross Milano Cortina 2026, the Olympic moment everyone trains for is colliding with the kind of design fail no one saw coming. In just the first days of competition, multiple athletes have watched their freshly awarded medals snap off their ribbons or show visible damage while they were still in celebration mode. Downhill champion Breezy Johnson revealed that her gold medal \"came apart\" as she jumped up and down after winning, holding up the detached medallion, ribbon and tiny connector piece for cameras in the mixed zone. Figure skater Alysa Liu followed with a viral clip, joking that \"my medal don’t need the ribbon\" as she displayed her own separated gold. German biathlete Justus Strelow and Swedish cross-country star Ebba Andersson have also seen their bronze and silver hardware fail while still on site at the Games.The incidents are more than just awkward optics. For athletes who have spent years chasing this hardware, a medal that cracks, chips or hits the floor within hours raises serious questions about quality control at one of the world’s most scrutinised sporting events. Early analysis from national committees and local media points to a weak link where the heavy medallion meets a softer pin or clasp system, making the awards vulnerable when athletes jump, dance or even let the medal swing freely. The controversy also taps into a wider pattern, echoing complaints about tarnishing and damage to Paris 2024 medals that forced organisers there to process hundreds of replacement requests once athletes went home.Under growing pressure, Milano Cortina officials have shifted into damage-control mode. Chief games operations officer Andrea Francisi has confirmed that organisers are \"fully aware\" of the failures and are now examining exactly what went wrong in collaboration with partners, with a clear mandate that the medals must be flawless at the moment they’re placed around an athlete’s neck. The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee and other delegations say they are awaiting guidance on potential fixes or replacement policies, while the organising committee weighs whether a more robust attachment solution or backup stock will be needed before the next wave of podiums hits the global feed.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "SummaryMcLaren has unveiled the papaya-heavy MCL40 livery for the 2026 Formula 1 season at a launch event in BahrainThe reigning double world champions carry their championship-winning colour scheme into a new era of chassis and power unit regulationsLando Norris and Oscar Piastri stay on as McLaren’s unchanged driver pairing as the team targets another constructors’ and drivers’ title defenceMcLaren has taken the covers off the MCL40 in Bahrain, revealing a 2026 livery that leans hard into the team’s iconic papaya and black palette while adding subtle tweaks rather than a full reset. The new look arrives as McLaren heads into F1’s regulation reboot as back-to-back constructors’ champions and with Lando Norris preparing to defend the drivers’ crown he sealed in Abu Dhabi last year. The launch was staged at the Bahrain International Circuit and streamed globally, underscoring how central the desert venue has become to McLaren’s new-era narrative.Underneath the familiar colours sits a car built for radically revised rules, with smaller, lighter chassis and overhauled hybrid power units reshaping how teams find lap time. McLaren has already put an all-black stealth version of the MCL40 through a private shakedown in Barcelona, logging hundreds of kilometres to debug systems before official testing. With Norris running the number 1 plate and Oscar Piastri pushing to turn last season’s title challenge into something bigger, the message from Woking is clear. The livery might celebrate continuity, but the intent is to master F1’s 2026 reset faster than anyone else on the grid.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

Reports that Aberdonians have not seen so much as a sliver of sun since 21 January prompted an outburst of stoicism on BBC radio, with one resident commenting: “You have to get on with it, brighter days&nbsp;are coming”.Before then, however, north-east Scotland is braced for more heavy rain. For farmers and businesses in the affected areas, the impact goes far beyond inconvenience. Marketing consultant Sam Kirby told the Guardian that she had to work from a car park in Cornwall following Storm Goretti, because her broadband wasn’t working.

As the grid prepares to welcome its 11th entry, the American squad bypassed the traditional paddock launch, opting instead for a dual-threat reveal at Levi's Stadium and New York City’s Times Square. The debut signals the final stretch before the team’s first on-track appearance, blending General Motors' engineering heritage with a distinctively modern aesthetic.Visually, the challenger is defined by a stark, dual-color execution. The design splits the chassis into opposing black and white sections, bridged by a gradient pattern composed of repeating Cadillac chevrons. According to the team, this motif is engineered to create a sense of motion even when the car is at a standstill, while subtly nodding to the co-ownership structure between General Motors and the racing entity.The launch strategy emphasizes the team's intent to operate at the intersection of \"performance, culture, and entertainment.\" Dan Towriss, CEO of Cadillac Formula 1 Team Holdings, described the livery as \"unmistakably American,\" noting that the decision to debut during the Super Bowl was a calculated move to connect with fans beyond the traditional motorsport bubble. GM President Mark Reuss framed the unveil as the culmination of a years-long effort to earn a spot on the grid, setting the stage for the team's operational debut in Melbourne. Check out the announcement details above. The Cadillac Formula 1 Team will make its competitive debut at the Australian Grand Prix, running from March 6-8 in Melbourne.&nbsp;View this post on Instagram&nbsp;A post shared by Cadillac Formula 1 Team (@cadillacf1)&nbsp;View this post on Instagram&nbsp;A post shared by Cadillac Formula 1 Team (@cadillacf1)Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "SummaryInitial reports suggested that Bad Bunny’s halftime performance set a record with over 135 million viewersNFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy clarified that no official viewership data has been authorized or released by the leagueThe official tally from Nielsen is not expected until Tuesday afternoon following the Seattle Seahawks’ victory over the New England PatriotsBad Bunny’s Super Bowl LX Halftime Show performance is looking to set a new record as the most-watched halftime show in history.Early figures report that this year’s halftime show’s reach hit a fever pitch after unofficial tallies cited a record-breaking 135.4 million viewers. This figure would place Bad Bunny at the top of the Super Bowl’s all-time viewership list, narrowly edging out Kendrick Lamar’s 133.3 million from 2025.However, the NFL has moved quickly to manage expectations, with spokesperson Brian McCarthy taking to social media to label the circulating data as \"random\" and confirming that nothing has been officially sanctioned by the league: \"Seeing some random Super Bowl halftime and game viewership numbers floating around. Nothing has been released yet.\"Media insiders further reinforced this stance, noting that the standard measurement used by the league (Nielsen’s Big Data and Panel) has not yet finished processing the final count. Historically, halftime show metrics are released alongside or shortly after the overall game viewership numbers, which are typically made public on the Tuesday following the event. Until that window opens, the league remains in a holding pattern, distancing itself from the hype surrounding the alleged record.The performance itself has already become a focal point of cultural commentary, contrasting sharply with alternative broadcast events and sparking widespread discussion across social platforms. While the Seattle Seahawks secured a dominant 29-13 win on the field, the narrative surrounding Bad Bunny’s star power continues to dominate the post-game cycle.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "SummarySmythson and sacai have announced a collaboration launching on February 13, 2026The collection features three signature Smythson items—a passport cover, pouch, and Chelsea notebook—reinterpreted with sacai's hybrid aestheticDesigned by sacai Creative Director Chitose Abe, the pieces feature miniaturized briefcase handles on small leather goods, blending utility with surrealism.British luxury stationer Smythson and Japanese fashion house sacai are bridging the gap between heritage craftsmanship and avant-garde design with a new collaborative capsule. Launching on February 13, 2026, the partnership was born out of a genuine appreciation for the brand by sacai Creative Director Chitose Abe, a long-time user of Smythson’s travel accessories and diaries. The result is a collection that \"layers\" sacai's distinctive hybrid philosophy onto Smythson’s 130-year-old traditions, creating everyday items that feel both familiar and unexpectedly new.The collection focuses on three of Smythson's most enduring silhouettes -- the passport cover, the pouch, and the Chelsea notebook. All three are crafted from Smythson’s signature black Crossgrain Panama leather, providing a unified, classic canvas. However, the design takes a sharp turn into sacai's \"disruptive\" territory with the addition of miniaturized structured handles to each piece. Inspired by Smythson’s archival briefcases and luggage, these handles are repurposed on small leather goods where they serve no traditional function, creating a playful juxtaposition of scale and utility that defines Abe's design language.\"I feel that Smythson’s products have a quality that enriches everyday life,\" said Chitose Abe regarding the project. \"By building on the shared philosophy at the core of both brands... I believe we were able to create a new sense of everyday.\" This sentiment is echoed by the collection's construction, which maintains the functional excellence Smythson is known for while transforming the items into conversation pieces. The Smythson x sacai capsule will be available starting February 13, 2026 via Smythson boutiques, sacai locations and select global retailers.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

The aesthetic is grounded by a translucent rubber outsole and an EVA midsole, blending premium materials with an experimental edge.Central to the design is the new BadBo signature logo.

        "title": "New Devices Might Scale the Memory Wall",
        "text": "The hunt is on for anything that can surmount AI’s perennial memory wall–even quick models are bogged down by the time and energy needed to carry data between processor and memory. Resistive RAM (RRAM)could circumvent the wall by allowing computation to happen in the memory itself. Unfortunately, most types of this nonvolatile memory are too unstable and unwieldy for that purpose.Fortunately, a potential solution may be at hand. At December’s IEEE International Electron Device Meeting (IEDM), researchers from the University of California, San Diego showed they could run a learning algorithm on an entirely new type of RRAM.“We actually redesigned RRAM, completely rethinking the way it switches,” says Duygu Kuzum, an electrical engineer at the University of California, San Diego, who led the work.RRAM stores data as a level of resistance to the flow of current. The key digital operation in a neural network—multiplying arrays of numbers and then summing the results—can be done in analog simply by running current through an array of RRAM cells, connecting their outputs, and measuring the resulting current.Traditionally, RRAM stores data by creating low-resistance filaments in the higher-resistance surrounds of a dielectric material. Forming these filaments often needs voltages too high for standard CMOS, hindering its integration inside processors. Worse, forming the filaments is a noisy and random process, not ideal for storing data. (Imagine a neural network’s weights randomly drifting. Answers to the same question would change from one day to the next.) Moreover, most filament-based RRAM cells’ noisy nature means they must be isolated from their surrounding circuits, usually with a selector transistor, which makes 3D stacking difficult.Limitations like these mean that traditional RRAM isn’t great for computing. In particular, Kuzum says, it’s difficult to use filamentary RRAM for the sort of parallel matrix operations that are crucial for today’s neural networks.So, the San Diego researchers decided to dispense with the filaments entirely. Instead they developed devices that switch an entire layer from high to low resistance and back again. This format, called “bulk RRAM”, can do away with both the annoying high-voltage filament-forming step and the geometry-limiting selector transistor.3D memory for machine learningThe San Diego group wasn’t the first to build bulk RRAM devices, but it made breakthroughs both in shrinking them and forming 3D circuits with them. Kuzum and her colleagues shrank RRAM into the nanoscale; their device was just 40 nm across. They also managed to stack bulk RRAM into as many as eight layers.With a single pulse of identical voltage, an eight-layer stack of cells each of which can take any of 64 resistance values, a number that’s very difficult to achieve with traditional filamentous RRAM. And whereas the resistance of most filament-based cells are limited to kiloohms, the San Diego stack is in the megaohm range, which Kuzum says is better for parallel operations.“We can actually tune it to anywhere we want, but we think that from an integration and system-level simulations perspective, megaohm is the desirable range,” Kuzum says.These two benefits–a greater number of resistance levels and a higher resistance–could allow this bulk RRAM stack to perform more complex operations than traditional RRAM’s can manage. Kuzum and colleagues assembled multiple eight-layer stacks into a 1-kilobyte array that required no selectors. Then, they tested the array with a continual learning algorithm: making the chip classify data from wearable sensors—for example, reading data from a waist-mounted smartphone to determine if its wearer was sitting, walking, climbing stairs, or taking another action—while constantly adding new data. Tests showed an accuracy of 90 percent, which the researchers say is comparable to the performance of a digitally-implemented neural network.This test exemplifies what Kuzum thinks can especially benefit from bulk RRAM: neural network models on edge devices, which may need to learn from their environment without accessing the cloud. “We are doing a lot of characterization and material optimization to design a device specifically engineered for AI applications,” Kuzum says. The ability to integrate RRAM into an array like this is a significant advance, says Albert Talin, materials scientist at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, California, and a bulk RRAM researcher who wasn’t involved in the San Diego group’s work. “I think that any step in terms of integration is very useful,” he says.But Talin highlights a potential obstacle: the ability to retain data for an extended period of time. While the San Diego group showed their RRAM could retain data at room temperature for several years (on par with flash memory), Talin says that its retention at the higher temperatures where computers actually operate is less certain. “That’s one of the major challenges of this technology,” he says, especially when it comes to edge applications.If engineers can prove the technology, then all types of models may benefit. This memory wall has only grown higher this decade, as traditional memory hasn’t been able to keep up with the ballooning demands of large models. Anything that allows models to operate on the memory itself could be a welcome shortcut.",

While the exterior remains under wraps until May, the brand has unveiled a revolutionary interior concept co-developed with Sir Jony Ive and Marc Newson of LoveFrom. This collaboration marks a significant pivot from industry trends, prioritizing tactile engagement and material excellence over the ubiquitous \"screenification\" of modern luxury EVs.The cabin’s architecture draws heavily from avionics and high-end horology to create an interface that is \"physical and engaging.\" A central 12.86-inch instrument binnacle features a physical aluminum needle backed by a high-contrast OLED display, blending analogue tradition with digital precision. The three-spoke steering wheel is crafted from 100% recycled aluminum alloy and lacks any plastic components, featuring physical buttons for drive modes rather than capacitive touch surfaces.Tech-wise, the Luce introduces \"Fusion5\" glass developed with Corning—a material never before used in automotive applications. A 10.12-inch central screen sits on a ball-and-socket joint for adjustability, while a magnetized dock treats the key fob as a centerpiece, using E Ink to transition its color from yellow to black upon connection. Under the hood, the EV promises a \"mighty\" powertrain exceeding 1,000bhp, ensuring the electric transition doesn't compromise on performance. Check out the interior details above. The Ferrari Luce is scheduled for a full exterior reveal in May 2026.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

We present an ion mobility-resolved mass cytometry technology that integrates high-throughput single-cell injection with ion mobility-mass spectrometry for multidimensional metabolomic profiling. Ion mobility-enabled selective ion accumulation and cell superposition-based amplification strategies substantially enhance sensitivity, robustness and overall analytical performance. Combined with our computational tool, MetCell, this technology allows high-throughput analysis while achieving exceptional profiling depth, detecting over 5,000 metabolic peaks and annotating approximately 800 metabolites per cell-representing a 3-fold to 10-fold improvement over existing methods. It offers attomole-level sensitivity and captures a broad dynamic range of metabolites within individual cells. Applied to 45,603 primary liver cells from aging mice, it enabled accurate cell-type and cell-subtype annotation and revealed distinct metabolic states and heterogeneity in hepatocytes during aging. This platform sets a new benchmark for high-throughput single-cell metabolomics, advancing our understanding of metabolic heterogeneity at single-cell resolution.\n                \n                Longevity Relevance Analysis\n                The paper claims to present a novel ion mobility-resolved mass cytometry technology that significantly enhances single-cell metabolomic profiling.

Transposons are suppressed in youth, the structure of DNA managed by epigenetic mechanisms to package away transposon sequences into heterochromatin structures and thus hide them from transcription machinery in the cell nucleus.

This includes mild stresses resulting from exercise, calorie restriction, heat, cold, and low levels of toxin exposure. The processes of autophagy act to recycle damaged or otherwise unwanted cellular components into amino acids that can be used for further protein synthesis, improving cell function. Thus there is interest in the scientific community in finding drugs that can induce increased autophagy. The best known, most readily available, and most advanced in the clinic are varieties of mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin being the canonical example.

Drawing on molecular, structural, organismal, and clinical research, this collection showcases a field in rapid motion, reshaping our view of regeneration, aging, and disease.\n                \n                Longevity Relevance Analysis\n                The paper discusses the role of telomeres and telomerase in aging and genome stability, suggesting that understanding these mechanisms can inform approaches to lifespan extension and age-related decline. The focus on telomere biology and its implications for regeneration and aging makes it relevant to longevity research.\n                \n                Read the full paper",
