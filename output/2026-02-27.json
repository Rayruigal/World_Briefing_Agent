        "text": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrives for a landmark trial over whether social media platforms deliberately addict and harm children, Wednesday, Feb. 18, 2026, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Ryan Sun)2026-02-26T21:38:55Z\n                                        LOS ANGELES (AP) — A young woman who is battling against social media giants took the stand Thursday to testify about her experience using the platforms as she was growing up, saying she was on social media “all day long” as a child.The now 20-year-old, who has been identified in court documents as KGM, says her early use of social media addicted her to the technology and exacerbated depression and suicidal thoughts. Meta and YouTube are the two remaining defendants in the case, which TikTok and Snap have settled.The case, along with two others, has been selected as a bellwether trial, meaning its outcome could impact how thousands of similar lawsuits against social media companies are likely to play out. KGM, or Kaley, as her lawyers have called her during the trial, started using YouTube at age 6 and Instagram at age 9. \n    \n        \n    \n\nA turbulent home life Kaley took the stand wearing a pink floral dress and a beige cardigan and said she was “very nervous” after her attorney, Mark Lanier, asked how she was doing Thursday morning.Lanier displayed childhood photos of Kaley and her family and asked about positive memories from her upbringing in a quiet cul-de-sac in Chico, California. She spoke of themed birthday parties, trips to Six Flags and her mom’s consistent efforts to make her childhood special.Still, Kaley’s relationship with her mother was challenging at times. Kaley said most of their arguments were over the use of her phone.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nBoth the defendants and the plaintiff have pointed to a turbulent home life for Kaley. Her attorneys say she was preyed upon as a vulnerable user, but attorneys representing Meta and Google-owned YouTube have argued Kaley turned to their platforms as a coping mechanism or a means of escaping her mental health struggles.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nWhen asked about claims that her mother had hit her, abused her and neglected her, Kaley said “she wasn’t perfect, but she was trying her best,” and clarified that she doesn’t think she would label her mother’s past actions as abuse or neglect today. Kaley, who works as a personal shopper at Walmart, still lives with her mother in the home she grew up in.\n    \n        \n    \n\nNotifications gave her a ‘rush’As a child, Kaley set up multiple accounts on both Instagram and YouTube so she could like and comment on her posts. She said she would also “buy” likes through a platform where she could like other people’s photos and get a slew of likes in return. “It made me look popular,” she said.Kaley was asked specifically about the features the plaintiffs argue are deliberately designed to be addictive, including notifications. Those notifications on both Instagram and YouTube gave her a “rush,” she said. She would receive them throughout the day and would go to the bathroom during school to check them — something she still does.Kaley said while she uses YouTube less often now, she believes she was previously addicted to it. “Anytime I tried to set limits for myself, it wouldn’t work and I just couldn’t get off,” she said.Filters on Instagram, specifically those that could change a person’s cosmetic appearance, have also loomed large in the case and were also a constant fixture of Kaley’s use. Lanier and his colleagues unfurled a nearly 35-foot-long canvas banner with photos Kaley has posted on Instagram. She said “almost all” of the photos had a filter on them.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe jury was also shown Instagram posts and YouTube videos Kaley posted as a child and young teen. One video that tapped into the popular trend at the time, sharing a nighttime routine, showed a young Kaley scrolling on her phone, showering and taking off makeup and then returning to her phone to go on Instagram. Another video showed her saying she was “crying tears of joy” after surpassing 100 YouTube subscribers — but then she quickly turned to her looks, apologizing for her “ugly appearance.” “I look so fat in this shirt,” the young Kaley says in the video. Meta has argued that Kaley faced significant challenges before she ever used social media. The company’s lawyer, Paul Schmidt, said earlier this month that the core question in the case is whether the platforms were a substantial factor in Kayley’s mental health struggles. During opening arguments, he spent much of his time going through the plaintiff’s health records, emphasizing that she had experienced many difficult circumstances in her childhood, including emotional abuse, body image issues and bullying.\n    \n        \n    \n\nKaley said she did not experience the negative feelings associated with her body dysmorphia diagnosis before she began using social media and filters.Kaley was asked about her peak Instagram usage, which exceeded 16 hours one day. “I just felt like I wanted to be on it all the time, and if I wasn’t on it, I felt like I was going to miss out on something,” she said.When she tried to stop using the platforms, she said she was often unsuccessful.“Every single day, I was on it all day long,” she said. \n    \n        \n    \n\nTherapist: Social media and sense of self ‘were closely related’Victoria Burke, a former therapist Kaley worked with in 2019, testified on Wednesday, and Burke said her social media and her sense of self “were closely related,” adding that what was happening on the platforms could “make or break her mood.” An attorney for Meta parsed through Burke’s notes from her sessions with Kaley extensively in a cross examination that lasted about three hours. He highlighted Kaley’s negative experiences with in-person bullying, other school-based sources of stress and anxiety and issues with her family. Mentions of social media in the notes were mostly limited to Kaley saying she didn’t feel she had a place at home, at school or among her peers, but did feel she had a place to be seen on social media. Burke’s treatment of Kaley lasted about six months and that period took place seven years ago.Platforms dispute addiction claimsThe case has been the subject of intense interest among both advocacy groups lobbying for enhanced child safety protections and the tech world alike, with high profile testimony from the head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.During Zuckerberg’s testimony, when he was asked if people tend to use something more if it’s addictive, he said “I’m not sure what to say to that.”“I don’t think that applies here,” he continued. He said he believes in the “basic assumption” that “if something is valuable, people will use it more because it’s useful to them.” Mosseri also said he didn’t believe people could become clinically addicted to social media platforms. The case is expected to continue for several weeks, and the outcome the jury reaches could shape the outcome of a slew of similar lawsuits against social media companies. Meta is also facing a separate trial in New Mexico.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                KAITLYN HUAMANI\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Huamani covers social media and internet culture for The Associated Press.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto\n    \n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n            \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                BARBARA ORTUTAY\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Ortutay writes about social media and the internet for The Associated Press.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto",

        "title": "NYC mayor says Trump agreed to immediately release Columbia student detained by ICE",
        "text": "A New York City police officer keeps watch on the campus of Columbia University in New York, May 6, 2024. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)2026-02-26T17:36:53Z\n                                        NEW YORK (AP) — A Columbia University student was arrested Thursday by federal immigration agents who claimed to be searching for a “missing person” in order to gain access to a campus apartment, according to her attorneys and the school’s president.Hours after she was taken into custody, though, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said in a social media post that he had discussed the arrest during an unrelated meeting with President Donald Trump, who agreed to release the student “immediately.”The student, Ellie Aghayeva, is a senior from Azerbaijan studying neuroscience and political science. A self-described content creator, she has amassed a large social media following by sharing day-in-the-life videos and tips for navigating college as an immigrant.At around 7:00 a.m., Aghayeva posted a message to her more than 100,000 followers on Instagram: “DHS illegally arrested me. Please help.” A photo accompanying the post appeared to show the backseat of a vehicle. \n    \n        \n    \n\nA Department of Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed Aghayeva’s arrest and said her student visa had been terminated in 2016 for failing to attend classes. The spokesperson didn’t respond to questions about when or if she would be released.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nIn an emergency petition, attorneys for Aghayeva said she had entered the country on a visa in or around 2016. They said she was taken into custody early Thursday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, who didn’t have a warrant but “represented they were searching for a missing person to gain entry” to the university-owned apartment. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nShe was being held at the federal detention center in Lower Manhattan, the lawyers wrote. They declined to provide additional comment, including details about her immigration status. In an email shared with students and staff, the university’s acting president, Claire Shipman, said that federal agents had entered a residential building at around 6:30 a.m., claiming they were seeking a missing person. \n    \n        \n    \n\nShe said the university was in the process of reaching out to the student’s family and providing legal support.The use of disguises or other misrepresentations by immigration authorities has drawn attention in recent months, after federal agents were seen posing as utility workers and other service employees in Minneapolis and elsewhere. The practice is legal, in most cases. But immigration attorneys say such ruses are becoming increasingly common, adding to concerns about the Trump administration’s dramatic reshaping of immigration enforcement tactics nationwide.The incident comes nearly one year after federal agents detained Mahmoud Khalil, then a Columbia graduate student and Palestinian activist, inside his university-owned housing. Khalil is out on bail, fighting his own deportation case.In the months after his arrest, many students called on the university to do more to secure the campus from federal immigration enforcement. Columbia currently requires that all law enforcement agents have a judicial warrant or subpoena to access non-public areas of the university, including housing. In her email, Shipman said students should not allow law enforcement agents to enter non-public areas of the university and should not accept service of a warrant or subpoena, but should call campus public safety instead.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JAKE OFFENHARTZ\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Offenhartz is a general assignment reporter in the New York City bureau of The Associated Press.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto",

        "title": "Warner Bros. Discovery deems Paramount’s takeover bid superior to Netflix deal",
        "text": "The Warner Bros. water tower is seen at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, Calif., Dec. 5, 2025. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File)2026-02-26T21:36:12Z\n                                        NEW YORK (AP) — Warner Bros. Discovery has determined that Paramount’s latest takeover offer is superior to the streaming and studio agreement it struck with Netflix, marking a stark shift in momentum in the fight for the storied Hollywood giant.The owner of HBO Max, DC Studios and popular titles like “Harry Potter” had backed Netflix’s proposal for months. But after Skydance-owned Paramount upped its rival bid for the entire company to $31 per share, in addition to other revisions, Warner’s board on Thursday said that the offer “constitutes a ‘company superior proposal.’”That could mean the start of a fresh bidding war over Warner. Netflix now has four business days to try and match Paramount’s proposal to further revise its offer — which currently stands at $27.75 per share for Warner’s studio and streaming business. Warner on Thursday maintained that Netflix’s bid remains on the table. And despite Thursday’s decision, the board noted that it “has not withdrawn or modified” its previous recommendation in favor of that transaction.\n    \n        \n    \n\nNetflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nMeanwhile, Paramount CEO David Ellison applauded the news — noting in a statement that the company was “pleased WBD’s Board has unanimously affirmed the superior value of our offer.”The fight for Warner is complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things. Unlike the streaming giant, Paramount wants all of Warner’s operations, including networks like CNN and Discovery.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe companies have spent the last couple of months in a heated, public back and forth over who has a stronger deal. And Thursday’s announcement arrived shortly after Paramount upped the ante on its offer. Beyond increasing its proposed purchase price for Warner, the company also agreed to a regulatory termination fee of $7 billion.

        "text": "SummaryNetflix has withdrawn its bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, citing financial and regulatory challengesThis clears the path for Paramount Skydance to acquire the media giantThe move shifts focus back to Netflix’s core streaming and content strategyNetflix has officially withdrawn its multi-billion-dollar bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, effectively ending a high-stakes bidding war that has captivated the entertainment industry.In a joint statement, co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters announced that the streaming giant would not match the \"superior\" and \"sweetened\" offer recently submitted by Paramount Skydance, noting that at the required price, the deal was no longer \"financially attractive\". While Netflix executives expressed confidence that they would have been \"strong stewards\" of iconic brands like CNN and HBO, they ultimately emphasized a disciplined approach, characterizing the potential acquisition as a \"nice to have\" rather than a strategic necessity.The withdrawal also leaves the door open for other potential suitors, with Paramount reportedly still in discussions about possible partnerships or acquisitions involving Warner Bros. Discovery. For Warner Bros., the collapse of Netflix’s bid underscores the challenges facing traditional media companies in an increasingly competitive streaming market. While the company remains a major player with valuable franchises and assets, questions linger about its long-term strategy and financial resilience. Observers suggest that Warner Bros. may now look to restructure or pursue smaller-scale deals to strengthen its position, as the industry continues to evolve rapidly.The move comes as Netflix continues to focus on strengthening its own streaming platform and original content strategy, rather than pursuing large-scale mergers. Industry analysts note that the decision reflects Netflix’s cautious approach to expansion, prioritizing stability over aggressive consolidation.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "Pages from the Anthropic website and the company&#x27;s logos are displayed on a computer screen in New York on Thursday, Feb. 26, 2026. (AP Photo/Patrick Sison)2026-02-26T19:32:48Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said Thursday the artificial intelligence company “cannot in good conscience accede” to the Pentagon’s demands to allow wider use of its technology.The company said in a statement that it’s not walking away from negotiation but that new contract language received from the Defense Department “made virtually no progress on preventing Claude’s use for mass surveillance of Americans or in fully autonomous weapons.”The Pentagon’s top spokesman has reiterated that the military wants to use Anthropic’s artificial intelligence technology in legal ways and will not let the company dictate any limits ahead of a Friday deadline to agree to its demands.Sean Parnell said Thursday on social media that the Pentagon “has no interest in using AI to conduct mass surveillance of Americans (which is illegal) nor do we want to use AI to develop autonomous weapons that operate without human involvement.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nAnthropic’s policies prevent its models, such as its chatbot Claude, from being used for those purposes. It’s the last of its peers — the Pentagon also has contracts with Google, OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI — to not supply its technology to a new U.S. military internal network.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nParnell said the Pentagon wants to “use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes” but didn’t offer details on what that entailed. He said opening up use of the technology would prevent the company from “jeopardizing critical military operations.”\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions,” he said.During a meeting on Tuesday between Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, military officials warned that they could designate Anthropic as a supply chain risk, cancel its contract or invoke a Cold War-era law called the Defense Production Act to give the military more sweeping authority to use its products, even if the company doesn’t approve.\n    \n        \n    \n\nParnell mentioned only two of those consequences in the Thursday post on X and said Anthropic has “until 5:01 PM ET on Friday to decide.” “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk,” he wrote.Anthropic didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. It said in a statement after Tuesday’s meeting that it “continued good-faith conversations about our usage policy to ensure Anthropic can continue to support the government’s national security mission in line with what our models can reliably and responsibly do.”Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who is not seeking reelection, said Thursday that the Pentagon has been handling the matter unprofessionally while Anthropic is “trying to do their best to help us from ourselves.”“Why in the hell are we having this discussion in public?” Tillis told reporters. “This is not the way you deal with a strategic vendor that has contracts.”He added, “When a company is resisting a market opportunity for fear of negative consequences, you should listen to them and then behind closed doors figure out what they’re really trying to solve.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nSen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he was “deeply disturbed” by reports that the Pentagon is “working to bully a leading U.S. company.”“Unfortunately, this is further indication that the Department of Defense seeks to completely ignore AI governance,” Warner said in a statement. It “further underscores the need for Congress to enact strong, binding AI governance mechanisms for national security contexts.”As Pentagon officials say they always will follow the law with their use of AI models, Hegseth told Fox News last February, weeks after becoming defense secretary, that “ultimately, we want lawyers who give sound constitutional advice and don’t exist to attempt to be roadblocks to anything.”___Associated Press writer Ben Finley contributed to this report.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                MATT O’BRIEN\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                O’Brien covers the business of technology and artificial intelligence for The Associated Press.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto\n    \n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n                    \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n                    \n    获取更多RSS：https://feedx.net https://feedx.site",

(AP Photo)2026-02-27T03:46:51Z\n                                        ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan’s defense minister said that his country ran out of “patience” and considers that there is now an “open war” with Afghanistan, after both countries launched strikes following an Afghan cross-border attack. In a post on X Friday, Defense Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif said Pakistan had hoped for peace in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of NATO forces and expected the Taliban to focus on the welfare of the Afghan people and regional stability. Instead, he alleged, the Taliban had turned Afghanistan “into a colony of India,” gathered militants from around the world and begun “exporting terrorism.”“Our patience has now run out. Now it is open war between us,” he said. There has been no reaction from Afghan government officials to Asif’s comments.The latest escalation of violence between the neighboring countries makes a Qatar-mediated ceasefire appear increasingly shaky. The Pakistani defense minister didn’t mention the ceasefire.\n    \n        \n    \n\nAsif also accused the Taliban government of denying Afghans basic human rights, including rights for women that he said are guaranteed under Islam, without providing details or evidence.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nHe said Pakistan had tried to maintain stability both directly and through friendly countries.“Today, when attempts were made to target Pakistan with aggression, by the grace of God, our armed forces are giving a decisive response,” he said.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nAfghanistan on Thursday launched a cross-border attack on Pakistan in retaliation for deadly Pakistani airstrikes on Afghan border areas Sunday.Early Friday, Pakistan carried out airstrikes in Kabul and two other Afghan provinces. At least three explosions were heard in Kabul, but there was no immediate information on the exact location of the strikes in the Afghan capital, or of any potential casualties. Afghanistan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Pakistan also carried out airstrikes in Kandahar to the south and in the southeastern province of Paktia.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIn his post, Asif also said Pakistan had played a positive role over the past five decades, hosting about 5 million Afghan refugees. He added that millions of Afghans are still earning their livelihoods in the country.Pakistan launched a sweeping crackdown in Oct. 2023 to expel migrants without documents, urging those in the country to leave of their own accord to avoid arrest and forcible deportation and forcibly expelling others. Iran also began a crackdown on migrants at around the same time.Since then, millions have streamed across the border into Afghanistan, including people who were born in Pakistan decades ago and had built lives and created businesses there. Last year alone, 2.9 million people returned to Afghanistan, the U.N. refugee agency has said, with nearly 80,000 having returned so far this year.",

This time, commercial flights are not affected by the expanded airspace closure over Fort Hancock.Rep. Rick Larsen and several other top Democrats on the House Transportation and Infrastructure committee said they were notified through official channels.“Our heads are exploding over the news that DoD reportedly shot down a Customs and Border Protection drone using a high risk counter-unmanned aircraft system,” Larsen and the other representatives wrote. “We said months ago that the White House’s decision to sidestep a bipartisan, tri-committee bill to appropriately train C-UAS operators and address the lack of coordination between the Pentagon, DHS and the FAA was a short-sighted idea. Now, we’re seeing the result of its incompetence.”The Defense Department and Transportation Department referred questions to the FAA, which said in a brief statement that it had expanded the airspace closure around Fort Hancock. Border Protection did not immediately respond to questions.",

(AP Photo/Patrick Sison)2026-02-26T22:14:43Z\n                                        MIAMI (AP) — Word from the Cuban government of a deadly encounter between its troops and a boat carrying armed expatriates is casting a spotlight on Cubans living in the U.S. who still harbor aspirations of a counter-revolution 67 years after a guerrilla uprising ushered in communism.Cuban soldiers confronted a speedboat carrying 10 people as the vessel approached the island and opened fire on the troops, who fired back, killing four and wounding six, Cuba’s government says.One of the four killed was Michel Ortega Casanova – a man on an “obsessive and diabolical” quest for Cuba’s freedom from current circumstances, according to his brother in Miami.Misael Ortega Casanova said that his brother Michel is an American citizen who has lived in the U.S. for more than 20 years and still agonizes over the suffering that Cubans endure.“They became so obsessed that they didn’t think about the consequences nor their own lives,” Misael said of passions harbored by his brother.\n    \n        \n    \n\nAt the same time, Misael said that he did not recognize any of the names that the Cuban government released in connection with the boat incursion and that the shootings had caught his family by surprise.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n“No one knew,” Misael said of his brother’s plans. “My mother is devastated.”He said that while he doesn’t believe in heroes — “because that is ignorance” — he hopes that his brother’s death might be a worthwhile sacrifice.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“Maybe it will justify that some day Cuba will be free.”Cuban authorities, meanwhile, say Michel Ortega Casanova was accompanied on the boat by two men who are wanted “based on their involvement in the promotion, planning, organization, financing, support or commission” of terrorism, speaking of Amijail Sánchez González and Leordan Enrique Cruz Gómez.U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was wary of initial reports by Cuba and asserted that the U.S. would gather its own information about the people involved. His words also evoked a seemingly dormant history of subterfuge and armed provocations between the U.S. and Cuba.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“It is highly unusual to see shootouts in open sea like that,” Rubio said. “It’s something that hasn’t happened with Cuba in a very long time.”Conrado Galindo Sariol, another passenger, was identified as a former political prisoner in a 2025 interview with Martí Noticias, a U.S.-based news site that has long called for a change of government in Cuba.The Cuban government said the watercraft was a Florida-registered speedboat, and officials who searched it found assault rifles, handguns, homemade explosives, bulletproof vests, telescopic sights and camouflage uniforms.The shooting took place amid heightened tensions between the two countries as President Donald Trump’s administration tightens the U.S. embargo and threatens tariffs against countries providing Cuba with oil.Crucial oil shipments to Cuba from Venezuela were halted when the U.S. arrested Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in a Jan. 3 stealth nighttime raid by U.S. military forces.Guns and boats of mysterious provenance are hallmarks of both the guerrilla landing that spawned Cuba’s 1959 revolution, the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion by CIA-trained exiles in an attempt to topple its leader, Fidel Castro, and assorted skirmishes since then.\n    \n        \n    \n\nEmilio Izquierdo, a prominent exile in Miami who spent two years jailed in Cuba before arriving in the U.S. in 1980, cast doubt on Cuba’s initial reports of an armed incursion.He said that it was far more believable that foreign agents might have infiltrated Miami’s massive Cuban exile community and tricked government opponents into risking their lives on a suicide mission to overthrow the communist government in Havana.“This is an invention of the G2,” he said, referring to Cuba’s notorious spy agency. “Nobody with a 25-foot speedboat tries to overthrow a government.”The timing of the incident — with tensions between the U.S. and Cuba running at their highest in decades — was similarly suspicious, he said.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JOSHUA GOODMAN\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Goodman is a Miami-based investigative reporter who writes about the intersection of crime, corruption, drug trafficking and politics in Latin America.

        "title": "What to know about Defense Protection Act and the Pentagon’s Anthropic ultimatum",
        "text": "Dario Amodei, CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, attends the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 23, 2025. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber, File)2026-02-26T17:18:30Z\n                                        NEW YORK (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave Anthropic an ultimatum this week: Open its artificial intelligence technology for unrestricted military use by Friday, or risk losing its government contract.Defense officials in the Trump administration also warned they could designate Anthropic, which makes the AI chatbot Claude, as a supply chain risk — or invoke a Cold War-era law called the Defense Production Act to give the military more sweeping authority to use its products, even if the company doesn’t approve.Some experts say that using the law this way would be unprecedented, and could bring future legal challenges. The government’s efforts to essentially force Anthropic’s hand also underscore a wider, contentious debate over AI’s role in national security.Here’s what we know.\n    \n        \n    \n\nWhat is the Defense Production Act?The Defense Production Act gives the federal government broad authority to direct private companies to meet the needs of national defense.The act was signed by President Harry S. Truman in 1950 amid supply concerns during the Korean War. But over its now decades-long history, the law’s powers have been invoked not only in times of war but also for domestic emergency preparedness, as well as recovery from terrorist attacks and natural disasters.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nOne of the act’s provisions allows the president to require companies to prioritize government contracts and orders deemed necessary for national defense, with the goal of ensuring the private sector is producing enough goods needed during war or other emergencies. Other provisions give the president the ability to use loans and additional incentives to increase production of critical goods, and authorize the government to establish voluntary agreements with private industry.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe DPA is “one of the government’s most powerful and adaptable industrial policy tools,” said Joel Dodge, an attorney and the director of industrial policy and economic security at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.\n    \n        \n    \n\nAnthropic is the last of its AI peers to not supply its technology to a new U.S. military internal network. CEO Dario Amodei repeatedly has made clear his ethical concerns about unchecked government use of AI, including the dangers of fully autonomous armed drones and of AI-assisted mass surveillance that could track dissent. The Pentagon has maintained that it has no interest in using AI for mass surveillance or to develop autonomous weapons to operate without human involvement.If the Defense Department does invoke the DPA to give the military more authority to use Anthropic’s products without its approval, that could mean forcing the company to adapt its model to the Pentagon’s needs without built-in safety limits, or remove certain ethical restrictions from the company’s contract language. Experts like Dodge say both would be “without precedent under the history of the DPA.”“It’s a powerful law,” he said. ”(But) it has never been used to compel a company to produce a product that it’s deemed unsafe, or to dictate its terms of service.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nHow has this law been used in the past?Trump in his first term and former President Joe Biden invoked the DPA to boost supplies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. And during 2022’s nationwide baby formula shortage, Biden used the law to speed production of formula and authorize flights to import supply from overseas.Biden also invoked the DPA in a 2023 executive order on AI, notably in efforts to require that companies share safety test results and other information with the government. Trump repealed the order at the start of his second term.Decades ago, the administrations of both President Bill Clinton and George W. Bush used the DPA to ensure that electricity and natural gas shippers continued supplying California utilities amid an energy crisis. And the law was used after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in 2017 to prioritize contracts for food, bottled water, manufactured housing units and the restoration of electrical systems.The DPA requires periodic reauthorization to remain in effect, which can expand or refine the scope of the law. According to congressional documents, its next expiration date is slated for Sept. 30 of this year. Depending on how the Defense Department’s reported demands unfold, Anthropic could be at the top of lawmakers’ minds.\n    \n        \n    \n\nPossible next steps for Anthropic If the Defense Department uses the DPA provision aimed at prioritizing government contracts and ordering production of certain goods — which the Anthropic case suggests it would — a company can push back if the requested product isn’t something it already produces, Dodge and others say, or if it deems the terms to be unreasonable. But the government may try and overrule that, notes Charlie Bullock, senior research fellow at the Institute for Law &amp; AI. “If neither side backs down, it seems realistic that there would be litigation between Anthropic and the government,” Bullock said.Some have also noted tension between the Pentagon’s warning that it could designate Anthropic as a supply chain risk while also indicating its products are so important to national defense that it needs to invoke the DPA — two assertions that seem at odds with each other. \n    \n        \n    \n\nDefense officials appeared to be backing away from the DPA option on Thursday, when Chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell wrote on social media that if Anthropic didn’t agree to cooperate by 5:01 p.m. ET on Friday, “we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk.” “We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions,” Parnell added.Dodge thinks the administration is counting on “a lot of forces” as it aims to get Anthropic to bend on Friday.If Anthropic agrees to new terms in the face of such threats, that could open up “a Pandora’s box of what the government could do to assert power and control over private companies,” Dodge said.___Associated Press Writers Matt O’Brien in Providence, Rhode Island and Konstantin Toropin and David Klepper in Washington contributed to this report.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                WYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Grantham-Philips is a business reporter who covers trending news for The Associated Press.

        "text": "United States&#x27; Brady Tkachuk (7) celebrates after the United States defeated Canada in a men&#x27;s ice hockey gold medal game between Canada and the United States at the 2026 Winter Olympics, in Milan, Italy, Sunday, Feb. 22, 2026. (AP Photo/Petr David Josek)2026-02-26T19:59:49Z\n                                        OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — American hockey player Brady Tkachuk said Thursday that he did not appreciate a doctored TikTok video shared by the White House that made it look like he was disparaging Canadians after winning Olympic gold, calling it fake and something he would never say.The video includes fabricated audio of Tkachuk referring to Canadians as “maple syrup eating (expletive),” with the expletive bleeped out. The video carries a note saying it “contains AI-generated media.”“It’s clearly fake because it’s not my voice and not my lips moving,” Tkachuk said. “I’m not in control of any of those accounts. … I know that those words would never come out of my mouth.”Asked if he liked the video, Tkachuk said he did not: “I would never say that. That’s not who I am.”The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n    \n        \n    \n\nTkachuk also denied being the voice heard shouting “close the northern border” during Team USA’s celebratory phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump after Sunday’s 2-1 overtime win over Canada to win the gold medal at the Winter Olympics.“I’ve been seeing stuff that people think it’s me, but if you watch the video, that’s not my voice and something that I never say,” Tkachuk said. “I don’t really know how that kind of took a storm on its own when I play here and give everything I have here.”\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nTkachuk, a 26-year-old Arizona native, is the captain of the NHL’s Ottawa Senators and has played his entire career in the Canadian capital. He and other members of the U.S. team returned from Italy this week and are resuming the NHL season. Some attended Trump’s State of the Union speech in Washington on Tuesday night and were cheered by those in attendance. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe U.S. women also beat Canada 2-1 in overtime, the first time the Americans swept both Olympic hockey tournaments. The celebration of the twin victories has been shadowed by U.S. politics almost since the final horn of the men’s game. \n    \n        \n    \n\nTalking on a speakerphone in the postgame locker room, Trump extended an invitation to the White House to the men’s team, then added, “We’re going to have to bring the women’s team, you do know that.” The president also joked that if he didn’t extend the invitation, he would probably be impeached. Some of the men’s players chuckled, something at least one said they regretted later. Tkachuk said he understood how the moment on the phone call could have been viewed by the women’s players.“I mean, I get it,” he said. “We supported them, they supported us. You can’t control what other people say.”A number of the men’s players traveled to Washington on Tuesday and visited Trump in the White House before being guests at the State of the Union. Many of the women’s players, meanwhile, were on the way back to their professional or college clubs. They didn’t learn they had also had been invited until late Sunday, making it difficult to change travel plans already disrupted by bad weather on the East Coast.In his address, Trump said plans were in the works to have the women’s team visit the White House, though it was unclear when that could happen. The earliest the team could travel to Washington would be in late spring after the conclusion of the PWHL season.\n    \n        \n    \n\nIn the meantime, rapper Flavor Flav scheduled a July celebration for the women’s team in Las Vegas for those who can make it.Hilary Knight earlier this week said she doesn’t want to let what she called a “distasteful” joke by Trump get in the way of a historic performance by American women at the Winter Games. Players for both U.S. teams have been uniform in saying how much they bonded in the athletes’ village in Milan and supported each other on their runs to gold.“Our two teams were so close. We watched other events together. We went and supported them. We loved the women’s team. The women’s team loved us and we’re so proud that we had a clean sweep of gold medals and just so much respect for them and the other athletes,” said Florida Panthers star Matthew Tkachuk, Brady’s brother. \n    \n        \n    \n\nBrady Tkachuk was asked about being a proud American while being the Senators captain at a moment of heightened tension between the countries.“First and foremost, I’ve given absolutely everything I have as an Ottawa Senator — blood, sweat and tears,” Tkachuk said. “When you represent the U.S., being an American, it’s an honor. There are only three teams that have won the gold medal for the U.S., so to be part of that is special.”___AP writers Melissa Goldin, Tim Reynolds and John Wawrow as well as the Canadian Press contributed.___AP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n                    \n    获取更多RSS：https://feedx.net https://feedx.site",

        "text": "SummaryRedOctane Games, the relaunched Guitar Hero studio, has unveiled Stage Tour, a new plastic-instrument rhythm game targeting a Fall 2026 launch on PC and consolesStage Tour supports guitar, drums, vocals and additional inputs like keyboard, mouse and gamepad, with new Kramer-style guitar, drum kit and microphone hardware planned alongside the gameThe game is built as a long-term live platform with seasonal events, deep competitive systems and community-driven development, including a closed alpha playtest planned for summer 2026Stage Tour marks the official comeback of RedOctane, the Guitar Hero veterans now operating under Embracer Freemode and determined to restart the plastic-instrument era on their own terms. Revealed during IGN Fan Fest 2026, the game leans into classic five-fret note highways and full-band setups, but pairs them with motion-captured performances from Eidos Montréal and modern live-service thinking instead of an endless sequel cycle.Players will be able to run full bands across lead guitar, drums, vocals and a Groove lane, or keep it simple with mouse, keyboard or standard controllers. RedOctane is lining up a new Kramer-inspired guitar bundle, a fresh drum controller and wired and wireless mics, while also confirming flexible input support and plans for release across PC and a wide range of consoles. An exact platform list and tracklist are still under wraps.Rather than chasing annual releases, RedOctane is positioning Stage Tour as a single evolving hub for rhythm diehards and newcomers. The studio is promising regular in-game events, seasonal content drops and a deep competitive backbone, with charting systems that react to both difficulty and instrument type. A closed alpha is scheduled to kick off in late spring or early summer 2026, giving the tightly knit rhythm community a chance to stress-test the systems before the game’s Fall 2026 launch window.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "SummaryStreamer Adin Ross has purchased the legendary Breaking Bad home in Albuquerque, New Mexico after a highly competitive bidding warThe four-bedroom property was most recently listed for $400,000 USD before Ross locked it down with a winning $1.3 USD million offerRoss intends to convert the home's interior into a flawless one-to-one recreation of the sets used throughout the hit television seriesStreamer Adin Ross is officially stepping into Heisenberg's territory after successfully purchasing the iconic Breaking Bad house. Securing the world-famous Albuquerque, New Mexico property following a heated bidding war, the internet personality is gearing up to breathe new life into one of television's most recognizable pieces of real estate.As per TMZ, the iconic four-bedroom, one-bathroom residence initially sat on the market for over a year with an ambitious $4 million USD asking price before being temporarily pulled. Recently relisted for an approachable $400,000 USD, the culturally significant location reportedly drew in approximately 20 legitimate offers. Ultimately, Ross closed the high-profile real estate deal by dropping a staggering $1.3 million USD to claim the keys.While the hit show's exterior shots famously utilized the actual home, the interior scenes were entirely filmed on separate sound stages. Ross has already announced his ambitious vision to completely renovate the space, aiming to build a perfect one-to-one replica of Walter White and his family’s fictional pad. The lucrative acquisition arrives as a massive relief to the previous seller Joanne Padilla, who was previously blocked from converting the residence into a dedicated fan museum due to strict residential zoning laws.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "title": "Why Tiger Woods Now Prefers Classic Golf Shoes",
        "text": "Remember that image of Tiger Woods at the 2013 Masters? Head-to-toe Nike. The geometric, color-blocked polos with matching belts. And those wide-toe synthetic shoes, the TW '13s, even saw a retro release a few years ago. It was the peak of golf's sneaker era, and Tiger was its greatest spokesperson.But priorities change. Injuries and their comebacks tend to mark the chapters of Tiger's career. And by 2022, returning from the car crash that nearly ended his life, his footwear had changed with him.\"I have very limited mobility now with the rods and plates and screws that are in my leg,\" Tiger said that spring. \"I needed something different, something that allowed me to be more stable.\"That \"something\" was the FootJoy Premiere Series: a conventional-looking shoe built around lateral stability, traction and conventional heel drop. This was less of a style choice and more of a physician's recommendation.Those preferences have carried into his post-Nike era with Sun Day Red, where the Pioneer line reflects the same idea: classic visuals with stability-first engineering.When the team showed him early concepts, one design stood out immediately. \"We knew he wanted something in a more classic vein,\" Sun Day Red footwear designer Tyler Pinkos told us last month. \"We showed him about 15 designs, and he pointed to one and said, 'That's me. I'm that guy. I’m a classical guy.' What he liked most was the foundation—a more stable, more rigid bottom.\"That philosophy shows up in details most players will never notice. The Pioneer shoes use a subtle heel profile borrowed from dress footwear, but with far less heel drop than traditional golf shoes (6 mm to be exact), so you get the grounded stance Tiger wants without raising the foot or interrupting balance.\"The athletic brands don’t really do that,\" Pinkos said. \"So we took inspiration from dress shoes and did a lot of research around stability—the foam compounds, the heights, the durometers. We left no stone unturned on the tooling. Once that was right, the upper was almost the easy part.\"The newest model, the Pioneer Willow, keeps that same chassis while refining the silhouette with cleaner lines, open lacing and a slightly more streamlined profile. It's different aesthetics, but the same underlying idea.Which is really the point. As Tiger's career has shifted, so has his definition of performance. The sneaker-inspired look of the 2010s gave way to something more grounded, shaped by feel, stability and his focus on longevity. Classic, in this case, isn't about form. It's about building a shoe that meets Tiger where he is now.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "title": "A24 Music's Next Move? Sophia Stel",
        "text": "A24 has always possessed a sonic stronghold, pairing music with visuals in such an intentional, uniquely immersive caliber that has situated the indie production company as an audiovisual empire.Founded in 2012, A24 has asserted itself in the music zeitgeist by way of internally curated and distributed soundtracks and scores, special-edition vinyl releases, and associating closely with the artists who are actively shaping the scene. In 2012, the production company solidified its sonic stance with the launch of \"A24 Music\" – a hub for all things music-related – and, as its catalog expanded, doubled down last April with the introduction of its official \"A24 Music\" record label, levelling up beyond just captivating backing tracks.Yesterday, the imprint signed its second artist to the label, emerging Vancouver-bred talent Sophia Stel. Bridging electronic subgenres with refreshing indie tropes, Stel is steadfast in the pursuit of her own lane, refusing to adhere to any genre constraints or preconceived paths.With a solid second signee now penned to the label, A24 continues to elevate its active championing of cross-disciplinary cultural relevancy. Revisit everything to materialize from A24 Music since its April 2025 debut.Signing the First Artist: Mark William LewisThe first official artist signed to A24's label was Mark William Lewis, an artist whose website describes him as one who \"exists between the cracks\" and \"eschews easy genre categorization.\" The British musician marked the first A24 Music talent to sign a non-soundtrack album with the label, first dropping off singles “Tomorrow is Perfect,\" \"Still Above,\" \"Seventeen,\" and \"Skeletons Coupling\" prior to the album drop. He released his self-titled LP, Mark William Lewis, in September of 2025.A Star-Studded Highest 2 Lowest Original Soundtrack, Starring A$AP Rocky and Aiyana-LeeFeaturing new music by starring actress Aiyana-Lee and supporting star A$AP Rocky, the Spike Lee-directed Highest 2 Lowest stamped A24's label as one to be reckoned with – like really reckoned with. In addition to contributions from its cast members, the crime-thriller film's original soundtrack also includes new music from artists all over the board, such as Jensen McRae, Eddie Palmieri, Howard Drossin, and the Fergus McCreadie Trio. Rocky's \"Trunks\" and \"Both Eyes Closed\" both landed on the final soundtrack.Special-Edition Vinyl ReleasesWhile rapidly ascending forward, A24 still reflects on its roots, re-releasing a handful of fan-favorite soundtracks on vinyl. One was Alex G's original score for I Saw The TV Glow, which came pressed on blue glow vinyl, featuring a holographic cover and a Mr. Melancholy sticker. Another was Bobby Krlic’s original Midsommar score, which was pressed on limited-edition sunshine-yellow vinyl, complete with never-before-released Hårga songs and a limited-release Fire Temple cassette.A.G. Cook's The Moment ScoreOne of A24's most anticipated endeavors of the year was, of course, Charli XCX's directorial debut, The Moment. None other than A.G. Cook handled the movie's original score, which came with a rollout just like any other non-soundtrack album. First came a formal announcement of the soundtrack – just like any other typical album announcement – which arrived in tandem with lead single, \"Dread.\" Then followed a steady string of additional pre-release singles, including \"Offscreen\" and \"Residue.\"The Eddington Soundtrack and ScoreBy Bobby Krlic and Daniel Pemberton, Eddington's entire sonic component was also a particularly strong one, no surprise, handled by A24 Music. As for the vinyl aspect, original artwork comes from Matt McCormick, along with a Keep Honking bumper sticker.The Materialists Soundtrack, Featuring Japanese Breakfast’s “My Baby (Got Nothing At All)”In the Celine Song-directed Materialists, Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal, and Chris Evans march to the beat of yet another spectacular original A24 score. A particular high point? Japanese Breakfast's “My Baby (Got Nothing At All).\"Nala Sinephro’s Original Score for The Smashing MachinePreceded by one single \"Grand Prix,\" Josh Safdie's The Smashing Machine original soundtrack was fully handled by Belgian Jazz musician Nala Sinephro. \"Music to train to\", to cry to, and to absolutely lose yourself to.The Marty Supreme SoundtrackDaniel Lopatin’s work on the music for Marty Supreme went down as one of the modern era's best film scores. Entirely produced by Lopatin, the Josh Safdie film garnered significant praise for the composer's ability to translate the wide range of on-screen emotions into a versatile sonorous journey. A24 also popped up globally with a slate of listening events in support of the film, showing out in hi-fi listening lounges in New York City, London, and Tokyo.Reviving the Cherry Lane Theater and Hosting Listening Events On-SiteOne of A24's biggest moves of 2025 was spearheading the reopening of the iconic Cherry Lane Theater in New York City's West Village neighborhood. The local imprint reopened its doors in September and soon became home to a lineup of community-based A24-hosted events. A24 initiated a \"Sound Check\" series of performances shot fully on the Cherry Lane stage. First, Mark William Lewis kicked it off, fresh off his self-titled project, followed up by Tame Impala, who performed a run of cuts from their newest album Deadbeat. A24 also hosted a conversation between Materialists director Celine Song and soundtrack contributor Japanese Breakfast; the two shared an intimate conversation on-stage, discussing everything from points of inspiration to the formula for a perfect love song.The SORRY BABY Score and Physical ReleaseBy Lia Ouyang Rusli, SORRY BABY's original score earned a special vinyl release, pressed on a specific New England-sky blue vinyl, stacked with early demos, commentary from filmmaker Eva Victor, and selected sheet music lifted from the film.And Lots of MerchIn true A24 fashion, no creative pursuit would be complete without a merch drop filled with wearables, homegoods, and things you didn't even know you needed. In this case? That means a harmonica.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "title": "A genetic analysis reveals new details on ancient couplings between humans and Neanderthals",
        "text": "This Friday, March 20, 2009 file photo shows reconstructions of a Neanderthal man, left, and woman at the Neanderthal museum in Mettmann, Germany. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner, File)2026-02-26T19:01:09Z\n                                        NEW YORK (AP) — Humans and Neanderthals cozied up from time to time when they lived in the same areas tens of thousands of years ago. But we don’t know much about who got with whom, or why.A new genetic analysis offers some ancient gossip: The pairings were more often female humans with male Neanderthals.How exactly this happened remains a huge question mark. Did human women venture into Neanderthal populations, or were the Neanderthal males drawn to larger human enclaves? Were these interactions peaceful, confusing, secretive or even violent?“I don’t know if we’ll ever get a definitive answer to how this happened, since we can’t travel back in time,” said population genetics expert Xinjun Zhang with the University of Michigan, commenting on the new analysis.But the study, published Thursday in the journal Science, shows “that whenever Neanderthals and modern humans have mated, there has been a preference for male Neanderthals and female modern humans, as opposed to the other way around,” said author Alexander Platt, who studies genetics at the University of Pennsylvania.\n    \n        \n    \n\nScientists know that Neanderthals and humans mated because there is a small but important percentage of Neanderthal DNA in most modern humans outside of sub-Saharan Africa — including genes that can help us fight some diseases and make us more susceptible to others. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nBut they have also known that the Neanderthal DNA is not distributed evenly throughout the human genome.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nIn particular, there is a surprising lack of Neanderthal DNA in the human X chromosome, one of the bundles of genes in each cell known as a sex chromosome, compared with the amount of Neanderthal DNA in the other, non-sex chromosomes in the cell. Scientists thought that maybe the genes in those locations were simply not beneficial – or even harmful. Perhaps people with those gene patterns didn’t survive as well so those genes were filtered out by evolution over time.\n    \n        \n    \n\nOr, they thought, maybe the difference could be explained by how the two species intermingled.To try to solve the riddle, Platt and colleagues looked instead at the Neanderthal genome and the human DNA that got interspersed during a “mating event” 250,000 years ago. When comparing these genes, they found more of a human fingerprint on the Neanderthal X chromosome – the same chromosome that, in humans, has less Neanderthal DNA than would be expected.The most likely explanation for this mirror image pattern is mating behavior. That’s because of the way sex chromosomes are passed from parents to children, explained Platt. Because genetic females have two X chromosomes and genetic males have one X and one Y chromosomes, two out of every three X chromosomes in a population, on average, are inherited from people’s mothers. If more human females mated with Neanderthal males than the other way around, over thousands of years you would expect to see just what they found: more human DNA in Neanderthal X chromosomes and less Neanderthal DNA in human X chromosomes. “I think that they’ve taken some really important steps in filling missing pieces to the puzzle,” said Joshua Akey, who studies evolutionary genomics at Princeton University and wasn’t involved with the new study.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe study can’t totally rule out other explanations. For example, Zhang said, it’s possible that the offspring of human males and Neanderthal females just didn’t survive as well.But the simplest and most likely, explanation, the study found, is also the most interesting: “It’s not the result of a strictly Darwinian survival of the fittest,” Platt said. “It’s really the result of how we interact with each other, and what our culture and society and behavior is like.”—-The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

        "title": "New Path to Battery-Grade Lithium Uses Electrochemistry",
        "text": "As electric vehicles roll off assembly lines, a bottleneck sits upstream: lithium refinement. Turning raw lithium into the compounds needed for batteries is expensive, messy, and energy-intensive, but Mangrove Lithium, a Vancouver-based startup, has a better way. The company has developed an electrochemical refining process that converts lithium feedstocks into battery-grade lithium hydroxide.Converting raw lithium to lithium hydroxide typically requires roasting spodumene—a mineral from which lithium is derived—at high temperatures, and then leaching it with acid to convert it to lithium sulfate. That compound then needs to be converted to lithium hydroxide. “It’s a thermochemical reaction that uses heavy amounts of reagent chemicals, and generates a sodium sulfate waste stream,” says Ryan Day, Mangrove Lithium’s director of operations.Further tightening the bottleneck, the majority of the world’s lithium—60 to 70 percent—is now refined in China, and export restrictions and geopolitical tensions have disrupted supply chains in recent years. Shipping raw lithium overseas to be refined also adds to batteries’ total carbon footprint. A new model for lithium refining could reshape not just the economics of electric vehicles, but the geography and environmental footprint of the global battery supply chain. Mangrove’s demo plant in British Columbia is scheduled to start production in the second half of 2026. How Does Mangrove’s Refinement Work?Mangrove replaces the conventional, resource-intensive reaction with a process that uses electricity, water, and oxygen. In an electrochemical cell, they flow brine through an electrolyzer, which consists of a metal box with three compartments between the cathode and anode. The compartments are separated by ion exchange membranes, semipermeable barriers that only allow certain ions to pass. Lithium sulfate flows through the central compartment, and the cell’s electric field splits the salt apart. “Lithium, which is a positive ion, will move across a membrane toward the cathode,” says Day. There, “we are reacting oxygen and water to create hydroxide ions, which join with the lithium from the salt to make lithium hydroxide.”Meanwhile, on the opposite side of the cell, the sulfate—a negative ion—moves towards the anode, where water is being split to produce protons and oxygen gas. The protons combine with sulfate ions to make sulfuric acid. “You run that process continuously, and over time you’re generating lithium hydroxide, which you can send to a crystallizer,” Day says. “There’s no significant waste product and all you’re feeding in is brine, water, oxygen, and electricity.” The sulfuric acid is recovered and can be circulated back upstream to leach more brine from the raw feed material. In general, keeping the ion exchange membrane intact is one of the biggest challenges for scaling this type of process, says Feifei Shi, assistant professor of energy engineering at Penn State. Shi, who researches electrochemical-based refinement methods, notes that the approach can more easily activate the necessary reactions,  but faces limitations for large-scale applications.   The electrochemical process separates out lithium by passing it through three compartments separated by semipermeable barriers. Mangrove LithiumMangrove’s Oxygen-Based CathodeMangrove’s key innovation and what enables the process is an oxygen-based cathode. “Driving the reaction requires detailed engineering,” says Day. The company designed an electrode that lets a gas and a liquid react together, using just enough water to make the oxygen reaction work—without adding so much that it floods the system and creates hydrogen gas instead.The electrodes are made with a proprietary process that combines several dedicated layers which allow for a balanced flow of water and oxygen to access the active catalyst sites. This design favors the oxygen reduction reaction for over 99.5 percent of the total cathode activity. It also reduces the amount of electricity needed to drive the process, because “oxygen reduction requires less voltage than water reduction,” Day says. Demand for battery minerals is surging beyond just lithium, with automakers competing for supplies of nickel, cobalt, graphite, and manganese. Simultaneously, utilities are deploying grid-scale batteries that use the same materials in even larger volumes. Refining capacity—not just mining—could become the critical choke point in this buildout, because battery makers require highly specified, ultra-pure compounds.While Mangrove is initially targeting lithium, their electrochemical architecture is not inherently lithium-specific, and could be adapted to other battery materials that face similar purification bottlenecks. Nickel and cobalt sulfate production, for example, still rely on multi-step precipitation and solvent-extraction processes that generate significant waste and require large reagent inputs. “It would work immediately in application to other alkali-metal salts,” Day says. Mangrove’s demo plant in British Columbia will make 1,000 tons per year of lithium hydroxide. If the company can scale its technology as it hopes, it could begin to reshape not just the battery supply chain, but the geopolitics of the energy transition.",

        "text": "This is a sponsored article brought to you by Audio Precision.Bluetooth started as a simple wireless connection between a phone and a headset. Since its inception, it has become the invisible scaffolding for music, calls, gaming, and hearing assistance across consumer and professional devices alike. Bluetooth’s evolution to support more use cases has been driven not by a single breakthrough but by a steady accumulation of radio innovations, codecs, transport schemes, and power management strategies that together enhance the user experience with wireless audio. Today, a new architectural baseline—Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) Audio—promises low-power, high quality, and scalable audio delivery to open up the standard for an even wider range of applications [1][2].Evolution of Bluetooth Radio TechnologiesThe original Basic Rate (BR) radio introduced with Bluetooth 1.0 in 1999 used a Gaussian frequency-shift keying (GFSK) at 1 Msym/s, hopping through 79 channels in the 2.4 GHz band with alternating transmission directions in a tight time-division duplex rhythm. The short-range robustness and reliability afforded by this technology helped gain performance at par with traditional cable-based devices.In 2003, the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) arrived as the enabling standard for stereo audio streaming over Bluetooth Classic, marking the technology’s expansion beyond voice into music playback. A2DP uses the Audio/Video Distribution Transport Protocol (AVDTP) for stream management and mandates the Sub-Band Codec (SBC) as its baseline audio compression format. The SBC codec employs 4- or 8-band analysis/synthesis filter banks with adaptive bit allocation, spanning bitrates from 128 to 345 kbps for stereo content. Embedded DSP work showed how to optimize SBC implementation—Weighted Overlap Add (WOLA) filter banks, fixed-point pipelines, and real-time decoding that is audibly indistinguishable from floating point reference implementations while consuming fewer MIPS and milliwatts [3].In 2004, Bluetooth 2.0 introduced Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) that moved payloads to π/4 DQPSK or 8 DPSK modulation to boost gross throughput to 2–3 Mb/s, while retaining the GFSK for packet headers. This innovation boosted stereo streaming quality and adoption during the decade.Around 2010, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 1 M PHY technology was introduced via Bluetooth 4.0. This new radio technology continued to use GFSK but tuned for low duty cycles and intermittent bursts. This fundamental difference with BR/EDR (Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate) led to common usage of the term “Bluetooth Classic” for Bluetooth 1.0 to distinguish it from BLE.Isochronous Transport ArchitectureIn late 2016, Bluetooth 5.0 introduced the LE 2M PHY, doubling the symbol rate to 2 Msym/s. For a healthy link margin, halving a packet’s airtime was found to reduce collision exposure and lower the energy delivered/bit. By 2020, Bluetooth 5.2 or Bluetooth LE Audio radically shifted the focus from continuous streaming to a transport designed explicitly around deadlines. LE (Low Energy) Audio leverages the existing LE 1M and LE 2M PHYs but carries audio over isochronous channels—slots with timing commitments. The isochronous channel architecture comes in two forms. Connected Isochronous Streams (CIS) are unicast flows whose parameters (intervals, subevents, retransmissions) can be tuned to meet frame deadlines with bounded jitter, enabling the radio to sleep predictably between bursts while the application knows precisely when a frame will arrive. A systematic review of BLE performance corroborates that output and latency in the real world are bounded as much by connection interval, event length, and retransmissions as by the raw symbol rate; under the right parameters, faster PHYs reduce radioactive time and improve energy efficiency, while coded long-range modes trade airtime for robustness in harsher channels [1].Broadcast Isochronous Streams (BIS)—commercially branded as Auracast—extend that scheduling to one-to-many transmissions, enabling connectionless audio delivery to unlimited receivers [2][7].This difference in architecture over continuous streams requires careful selection of intervals, packetization, codec forming and appropriate models to determine parameters that meet deadlines without wasting airtime. Markov chain analyses of CIS—validated via simulation—translate developer choices (intervals, subevents, retransmission counts) into quantitative predictions for packet loss rate (PLR), backlog, delay, throughput, and average power consumption. [7]The LC3 Codec AdvantageLE Audio’s Low Complexity Communication Codec (LC3) fundamentally shifts the bitrate-quality-complexity balance. Peer-reviewed listening tests across speech and music demonstrate that LC3 delivers superior perceived quality compared with SBC and mSBC at roughly half the bitrate; it also provides robust packet loss concealment and flexible frame sizes, including low-latency modes that make the encoding delay a smaller slice of the end‑to-end budget [2]. The benefits are practical: lower bitrate shrinks airtime, which reduces collision risk; shorter frames pair cleanly with CIS scheduling so deadlines are easier to meet; the codec’s computational footprint is modest enough for miniature devices [2]. Audio Precision provides high-performance audio analyzers, accessories, and applications that have helped engineers worldwide design, validate, characterize, and manufacture audio products for over 40 years. Hearing Aids: Power-Constrained Wireless AudioModern hearing devices are a complex assembly of multiple microphones, digital signal processors, and miniature power sources. Except for Completely-in-Canal (CIC) and Invisible-in-Canal (IIC) designs, which are so small they fit entirely within the ear canal, most hearing aids incorporate two or more microphones to support directional processing, beamforming, and noise reduction. Audio output is provided by a single electro-acoustic transducer. The compact form factor severely limits battery capacity, making energy efficiency critical.Compared to Bluetooth Classic (A2DP/HFP), LE Audio improves energy efficiency through three broad mechanisms: the LC3 codec achieves equivalent perceived audio quality at significantly lower bitrates than the SBC codec used in Bluetooth Classic; the LE 1M and 2M PHYs reduce on-air time per packet relative to BR/EDR; and Connected Isochronous Streams (CIS) enable precise scheduling, allowing the radio to sleep between transmissions, whereas BR/EDR audio requires longer active radio periods.BLE‑compliant wake‑up receivers (WuRx) monitor the air with micro/nano-watt sensitivity and trigger the main radio with packet preambles. Reported designs demonstrate sensitivity to extremely weak radio signals (down to −80 dBm), with within‑bit duty cycling that trades latency for power from hundreds of microseconds to seconds [4]. Sleep scheduling techniques primarily apply heuristics for periodic check‑ins, event‑driven wake-ups, clustering, and time division to stretch lifetime while meeting QoS targets [5][6].From True Wireless Stereo to Coordinated SetsBluetooth Classic’s A2DP supports only a single audio stream. In Bluetooth Classic’s True Wireless Stereo (TWS) devices, one earbud acts as the primary, receiving the stereo stream from the phone and relaying audio to the secondary earbud—a forwarding or relay architecture. The additional transmission hop adds latency to the secondary earbud, while increasing power consumption in the primary.LE Audio eliminates this limitation entirely. The technology’s dual CIS capability lets the phone send synchronized left and right streams directly to both earbuds. This architectural shift enables independent CIS connections from the phone to the left and right earbuds or hearing aids, enabling synchronized stereo delivery without relaying.Discovery and pairing have evolved to match multi‑device use. The Coordinated Set Identification Service (CSIS) allows two earbuds—or two hearing aids—to be discovered and managed as a coordinated set rather than independently, with resolvable identifiers and set‑level locks. While peer‑reviewed empirical literature on CSIS is thin, timing and carrier synchronization theory is mature: clock‑offset estimation, jitter control, phase‑locked loops, buffer alignment, and recovery strategies hold binaural timing within tens of milliseconds for lip‑sync and spatial imaging [9].Gaming Headsets: Low Latency With Bidirectional StereoGaming represents a demanding stress test for wireless audio. Bluetooth Classic’s Headset Profile (HSP) and Hands-Free Profile (HFP) support bidirectional audio for voice communication but are fundamentally limited: they transmit only in mono with a maximum sampling rate of 16 kHz, restricting both spatial audio quality and voice fidelity.LE Audio Unicast Voice transforms this scenario by supporting stereo audio with sampling rates up to 32 kHz, significantly improving spatial audio and speech quality for gaming while maintaining voice communication with other players. End‑to‑end latency often must stay under a few tens of milliseconds for responsive play and coherent spatial sound. LC3’s shorter frames and lower bitrates shrink codec delay; tuned CIS parameters preserve deadlines while limiting retransmissions to useful values; beamforming improves capture quality for bidirectional voice without ballooning computational cost [2][7].  Audio Precision’s new Bluetooth® 5 module provides an interface to audio devices using the latest version of the Bluetooth specification, including LE Audio devices utilizing Unicast and Auracast™. Adobe StockPublic Broadcast Audio: AuracastBluetooth Classic supports only one active audio connection and typically provides a range of approximately 10 meters, making it fundamentally unsuitable for broadcast scenarios such as lecture halls, churches, gyms, and airports.LE Audio introduces the Broadcast Isochronous Stream (BIS), commercially branded as Auracast, enabling true one-to-many audio transmission. Multiple hearing aids, headphones, and earbuds can receive the same broadcast, which may be public (e.g., airport announcements) or private (encrypted, non-discoverable, optional password protection). Typical Auracast ranges extend up to 30 meters indoors and 100 meters outdoors, depending on environment and configuration.BIS’s connectionless nature scales easily to unlimited receivers without pairing overhead; isochronous delivery tolerates packet loss well through forward error correction and interleaving; and the unidirectional transmission eliminates return traffic, reducing radio congestion. Assistive listening studies report that bypassing room acoustics and delivering audio directly can improve signal‑to‑noise ratios by 15–20 dB, making announcements comprehensible and lectures clearer [8].Ensuring It Sounds Good in, on or Over the Listener’s EarLE Audio delivers the music or voice signal more efficiently than its predecessor, Bluetooth Classic. Audio engineers still need to verify their devices’ audio performance as experienced by the end user.The listener’s pinna, the external part of the ear, and ear canal are a critical part of the playback system. For example, the low-frequency response and the effectiveness of active noise-cancellation are highly dependent on the seal between the device and the listener’s ear canal. Similarly, on-ear and over-ear headphones interact with the listener’s pinnas.Anthropomorphic test fixtures—most notably GRAS KEMAR (Knowles Electronics Manikin for Acoustic Research) head and torso simulators—incorporate soft, deformable anthropomorphic pinnas that replicate realistic insertion and sealing conditions. These allow accurate replication of insertion depth, sealing, low-frequency response, and ANC performance [10][12].Gaming headsets both receive and send audio. Just like music headphones, gaming headset testing benefits from fixtures with a human-like pinna to ensure repeatable measurement of ear-pad interaction. The headset’s microphone can be either a traditional boom microphone positioned close to the mouth or an array of microphones located farther away on the ear cups incorporating beamforming to isolate the wearer’s voice from any background noise. Test fixtures use an artificial mouth and a microphone positioned at the Mouth Reference Point (MRP) according to ITU-T standards to evaluate microphone performance under realistic speech and background noise conditions [10].For testing of devices intended as broadcast receivers, an integrated test system with Auracast broadcast capability—like the Audio Precision Bluetooth 5 module—proves invaluable.ConclusionBluetooth audio is no longer defined by a single radio or a single profile. It is defined by a timed pipeline—a codec that makes better sound with fewer bits, a transport that guarantees when those bits arrive, a radio that can sleep most of the time, and front‑end processing that gives the codec an easier job.Hearing aids illustrate the payoff: arrays and beamformers improve intelligibility first; LC3 compresses with low delay; CIS schedules delivery; the radio sleeps; batteries last. Enhancements in other applications, such as gaming and public broadcast, further strengthen the case for adoption of this cutting-edge technology.While Bluetooth audio began as a low-bandwidth, mono voice technology over Basic Rate (BR) radio in 1999, more than 25 years of evolution has produced a fundamental architectural shift. LE Audio replaces continuous point-to-point streams with scheduled, low-power, scalable audio delivery, enabling new classes of devices and use cases. The standards are ready, and audio test systems like Audio Precision’s Bluetooth 5 module are updated to incorporate the new transmission technology; the rest is execution—deploying LE Audio broadly so audio becomes instant, clear, and inclusive [2][7].References[1] Tosi, J., Taffoni, F., Santacatterina, M., Sannino, R., & Formica, D.

        "title": "How Stupid Would It Be to Put Data Centers in Space?",
        "text": "What’s the difference between a stupid idea and a brilliant one? Sometimes, it just comes down to resources. Practically unlimited funds, like limitless thrust, can get even a mad idea off the ground. And so it might be for the concept of putting AI data centers in orbit. In a rare moment of unalloyed agreement, some of the richest and most powerful men in technology are staunchly backing the idea. The group includes Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Jensen Huang, Sam Altman, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. In all likelihood, hundreds of people are now working on the concept of space data centers at the firms directly or indirectly controlled by these men—SpaceX, Starlink, Tesla, Amazon, Blue Origin, Nvidia, OpenAI, and Google, among others.  Likely costs to design, build, and launch a 1-GW orbital datacenter, based on a network of some 4,300 satellites and including operating costs over a five-year period, would exceed US $50 billion. That’s about three times the cost of a 1-GW data center on Earth, including five years of operation.John MacNeillSo how much would it cost to start training large language models in space? Probably the best accounting is one created by aerospace engineer Andrew McCalip. McCalip’s exhaustive, detailed analysis includes interactive sliders that let you compare costs for space-based and terrestrial data centers in the range of 1 to 100 gigawatts. One-gigawatt data centers are being built now on terra firma, and Meta has announced plans for a 5-GW facility, with anticipated completion some time after 2030.In an interview, McCalip says his initial rough calculations a few years ago suggested that data centers in space would cost in the range of 7 to 10 times more, per gigawatt of capacity, than their terrestrial counterparts. “It just wasn’t practical,” he says. “Not even close.” But when Elon Musk began publicly backing the idea, McCalip revisited the numbers using publicly available information about Starlink’s and Tesla’s technologies and capabilities.That changed the picture substantially. The figures in his online analysis assume an orbital network of data-center satellites that borrows heavily from Musk’s tech treasure chest—“essentially…you just start putting some radiation-resistant ASIC chips on the Starlink fleet and you start growing edge capacity organically on the Starlink fleet,” McCalip says. The network would rely on the kind of watt-efficient GPU architecture used in Teslas for self-driving, he adds. “You start dropping those onto the backs of Starlinks. You can slowly grow this out, and this would be approximately the performance that you would get.”Bottom line, with some solid but not necessarily heroic engineering, the cost of an orbital data center could be as low as three times that of the comparable terrestrial one. That differential, while still high, at least nudges the concept out of the instantly dismissible category. “I have my particular views, but I want the data to speak for itself,” McCalip says.For this illustration, we picked a configuration with an aggregate 1 GW of capacity. The network would consist of some 4,300 satellites, each of which would be outfitted with a 1,024-square-meter solar array that generates 250 kilowatts. The data center on that satellite, powered by the array, might have at least 175 GPUs; McCalip notes that a popular GPU rack, Nvidia’s NVL72, has 72 GPUs and requires 120 to 140 kW.The total cost of the satellite network would be around US $51 billion, including launch and five years of operational expenses; a comparable terrestrial system would cost about $16 billion over the same period.Stupid? Not stupid? You decide.",

        "title": "This Startup Makes Access to Rehabilitation Facilities Easier",
        "text": "When doctors in the United States refer patients to specialty or post-acute medical care such as physical therapy or long-term nursing care, nearly half never complete the process of finding help. Referrals stall in part because provider directories are outdated, insurance coverage is unclear, and much coordination still relies on phone calls and faxes.Carenector, a Denver-based startup launched in 2024, is working to improve the process with software that quickly connects patients with appropriate care providers while protecting their personal data. Instead of presenting a long list of providers, many of whom would not be a good match, the company’s referral platform uses AI to eliminate facilities that don’t meet the patient’s rehabilitation needs, don’t accept the patient’s insurance, or are not conveniently located.CarenectorCofounder:Naheem NoahFounded:2024Headquarters:DenverEmployees:5The startup’s platform serves individuals seeking care as well as health care organizations and care coordination teams that manage patient referrals. The company aims to help patients while reducing the administrative burden on clinicians and discharge planners, says cofounder Naheem Noah. As of now, Carenector works with patients and facilities only in Colorado, but it plans to expand coverage nationwide.Noah, a Ph.D. candidate who joined IEEE in 2022 as a student member, encountered the referral problem firsthand after tearing an anterior cruciate ligament in a knee while playing soccer. Finding a physical therapist who accepted his insurance, specialized in ACL rehabilitation, had appointments available, and was near his home required hours of phone calls and searches through inaccurate provider lists, he says.That experience helped shape the company’s direction, but Carenector is aimed at a broader, persistent failure in U.S. health care coordination.A broken referral systemThe company took shape when Noah connected with his cofounder, licensed social worker Aminata Diarra, a social director at a nursing facility. Her role included discharge planning: placing patients in post-acute-care facilities that bridge the gap between hospital discharge and the patient’s ability to independently manage life’s daily activities.For a single patient, Diarra says, that often meant she made 10 to 15 phone calls over the course of a week to find a facility with a bed available, that accepted the patient’s insurance, and that could meet the care requirements.She and Noah soon realized they were dealing with the same broken system from opposite sides. Existing research on referral lapses supported their experience. Primary care physicians often send referral notes—analogous to prescriptions—that list the patient’s medical history and describe the needed treatment.Noah discovered that only about one-third of the notes are transmitted in a way that allows providers at nursing homes and rehab facilities to access the information.Physicians often post their suggestions for ongoing treatment in sections of a patient’s electronic health records, but providers at post-acute facilities don’t have access to those because of medical privacy laws. What gets shared is a pared-down document that omits progress notes and discharge summaries.Engineering a research-driven startupNoah is currently a researcher in the University of Denver computer science department, where his academic work focuses on privacy and security in digital systems.He is Carenector’s chief executive and technical lead, overseeing the system’s design, making technical decisions, and meeting with investors.Although the startup is separate from his dissertation research, the company reflects his broader interest in building secure systems that work in real-world conditions.Beginning a company while a student, he has access to university resources that many early-stage startups lack. He has participated in the university’s BaseCamp accelerator and received mentorship and business planning support.The Carenector team was assembled with the plan to scale up in the future with health care compliance in mind. The group includes professionals from regulatory, legal, and data engineering fields.Replacing phone calls with digital matchingBy using standardized digital information shared among medical facilities, Carenector eliminates the need for staff to make phone calls or send faxes. At the core of the platform is a structured database that links care providers—including post-acute, specialty, and rehabilitation facilities—with insurance plan criteria and facility attributes such as accessibility and service capabilities.One of the biggest challenges for Noah is getting accurate data on which services facilities offer, which insurance they accept, and whether a patient’s insurance plan covers the treatment proposed by the referring physician.“Health care information in the United States is not centralized,” he says, “and insurance provider directories are often wrong or out of date.”To address that, Carenector incorporates publicly available datasets from the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), including plan attributes, service areas, quality ratings, and issuer-level transparency data. These public-use files provide plan-level and provider-level information that help standardize coverage criteria, geographic availability, and performance indicators. Carenector integrates this structured public data with facility-supplied information and referral outcome analytics to improve matching accuracy.“By replacing manual coordination with clear rules, accurate data, and built-in privacy protections, we hope to make accessing care a routine step in recovery—not another obstacle.”This structured data helps Carenector evaluate plan criteria, provider capabilities, geographic availability, and quality indicators to support referral decision-making. The company standardizes and organizes the information within its own system architecture and uses mapping and geolocation APIs to integrate location-based filtering and workflow functionality for patients, providers, and care coordinators.Because CMS data is updated periodically, Carenector supplements it with additional structured data sources and referral outcome analytics to better understand plan acceptance patterns. Room availability information comes directly from participating facilities, which are responsible for updating their status within Carenector’s system.Whether referrals succeed or fail provides critical feedback, Noah says. When referrals to specific facilities repeatedly go uncompleted—meaning the patient does not receive the recommended care from the provider—Carenector’s AI-driven matching algorithm adjusts to that pattern and reduces the likelihood of that facility being considered for similar cases. Facilities that consistently accept and complete referrals are ranked preferentially.Apps for patients and facilitiesThe company has poured its data management wizardry and AI smarts into apps for patients and clinicians.The patient app helps users locate appropriate health care services at no cost. Users can search for care by service type, ZIP code, or insurance company without creating an account. They receive a list of matching facilities that can be shared via clipboard or sent by email to themselves or family members..In the facility app, clinicians enter the diagnosis, rehabilitation needs, equipment requirements, insurance type, and location without sharing personally identifiable patient information. Organizations can communicate using secure messages that disappear after a set period. Files and images are shown only once and deleted after viewing.Facilities that use the app pay Carenector a flat fee for each successful referral. The patient app is free.The startup does not sell or share data with third parties, Noah says.“Privacy is a central design requirement for Carenector’s system, not a last-minute add-on to the finished product,” he says.The company minimizes the collection of personal data to avoid becoming a data repository. Although its role is limited to coordinating referrals, Carenector is working with independent security auditors to validate that its operational and data-handling practices align with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements. The HIPAA law sets standards meant to protect sensitive patient information from unauthorized disclosure.Noah says he is confident that Carenector will achieve that rating because the app is designed to reduce the collection and exposure of sensitive information wherever possible.Business model and measured expansionCarenector’s growth plan, Noah says, is strategic. Rather than scaling rapidly, he says, he is looking to enter one region at a time, incorporating feedback from each local deployment before expanding the company further.He envisions that in five years, Carenector will serve as a core piece of health care referral infrastructure—embedded in the workflows of hospitals, post-acute facilities, insurers, employers, and major electronic health record systems such as Epic and Cerner—while also increasing visibility for care facilities in underserved and remote areas. The plan, he says, is to support thousands of facility recommendations per day, compared with the approximately 200 daily facility recommendations it currently generates. Noah also looks forward to the broader adoption of APIs that allow care coordination and facility discovery to occur directly within clinical workflows.He says he sees his startup as a way to reduce unnecessary stress from moments when patients are vulnerable.“By replacing manual coordination with clear rules, accurate data, and built-in privacy protections,” he says, “we hope to make accessing care a routine step in recovery—not another obstacle.”",

A few hours later, these surfer fishers return with netfuls of their catch, riding waves on the final stretch back to the shore. From the main beach in Huanchaco – a seaside town near the city of Trujillo – the fish are taken to sell at the market or to beachfront restaurants preparing meals for tourists.The four-metre-long reed vessels – known as caballitos de totora in Spanish, or “little reed horses” – are placed upright on their ends by the promenade on El Mogote beach so that the seawater drains away and they are ready to be used the next morning.

        "text": "SummaryDavid Hockney’s historical 1965 painting \"English Garden\" is officially slated for auction at Sotheby's in LondonThe piece is expected to fetch between £2.5 million GBP and £3.5 million GBP at the upcoming modern and contemporary evening salePainted from memory while the artist lived in Colorado, the artwork marks a pivotal shift toward his signature landscape explorationsDavid Hockney’s \"English Garden\" painting is officially preparing to make its highly anticipated return to the public eye. Slated to hit the block at Sotheby’s modern and contemporary evening auction in London, the 1965 artwork represents the legendary artist's very first foray into English landscape painting and is estimated to fetch somewhere between £2.5 million GBP and £3.5 million GBP (approximately $3.38 million USD to $4.73 million USD).Created during a transformative era when abstract art dominated the global market, Hockney’s vivid portrayal of nature added profound new depth to the traditional landscape genre. The artist uniquely painted \"English Garden\" from memory while residing in Boulder, Colorado. The vibrant composition was heavily inspired by a photograph of English topiary work that Hockney discovered in an issue of American Vogue.According to Hockney’s 1988 book, the piece was developed concurrently with his renowned \"Rocky Mountains and Tired Indians\" (1965) painting. The artwork remains a crucial touchstone in his expansive catalog, signaling the rigorous explorations of natural scenes that would ultimately define his storied career.Held in a private collection since its last auction appearance in 1997, the painting will be displayed in Sotheby’s London galleries ahead of the official sale. The broader auction event will also feature prominent works from the School of London, including pieces by Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud, alongside modernist masterworks by Claude Monet and Edgar Degas.Hockney’s \"English Garden\" will hit the Sotheby’s auction block on March 4.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

Alzheimer's disease emerges very slowly over time, a process of damage and dysfunction that builds by stages over decades. The present consensus is that these early stages are dominated by amyloid-β misfolding and aggregation with only mild cognitive impairment at worst as the result. Only later is it the case that outright neuroinflammation and aggregation of phosphorylated tau protein come into play as the primary disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, forms of phosphorylated tau circulating in blood have proven useful as a marker of disease progression even in the early stages. Today's research materials report on the [&#8230;]",

The epigenetic response to environmental factors such as abundance of food is partially passed on to offspring to result in changes in the operation of offspring metabolism. Epigenetic and metabolic reactions to abundance of food affect pace of aging and life span, and these outcomes are also changed in offspring, even when the offspring live in a different environment with different abundance of food. Data in mice, nonhuman primates, and in humans demonstrate that exposure to maternal obesity increases the risk of multiple diseases in offspring. However, little is known about the aging effects of maternal obesity on the offspring. This study shows that maternal [&#8230;]",

Circadian rhythms regulate the amplitude and timing of immune responses, yet their mechanistic role in inflammation and longevity remains unexplored. In 62,000 adults with 7-day wearable accelerometry, interpretable machine learning model identified rhythm amplitude, stability, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as dominant predictors of accelerated aging. In a subset of 1521 participants (35% male) with available data on the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), we further examined the associations between behavioral rhythmicity and inflammation. Low amplitude and poor rhythm stability were associated with 0.31 and 0.18 SD higher SII; low MVPA to 0.33 SD higher SII in men (all p &lt; 0.05). Adding 15-min bout to daily MVPA or improving rhythm stability by 10-14% mitigated these effects. Sex-stratified mediation analysis revealed that inflammation accounted for 26% of the mortality risk associated with insufficient MVPA, 14% with rhythm irregularity, and 8% with low amplitude only in men. These findings position rest-activity rhythms as digital biomarkers linking daily rhythmicity to inflammation and survival and identify inflammation as a modifiable target for personalized interventions to foster healthy aging.\n                \n                Longevity Relevance Analysis\n                The paper claims that rest-activity rhythms serve as digital biomarkers linking daily rhythmicity to inflammation and survival. This research addresses systemic inflammation as a root cause of biological aging and identifies potential interventions to promote healthy aging, making it relevant to longevity research.\n                \n                Read the full paper",
