        "title": "Gifts and soup from ‘Uncle Jeffrey“: The Epstein ties that ended Kathy Ruemmler’s run at Goldman",
        "text": "White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler listens as President Barack Obama speaks at an installation ceremony for FBI Director James Comey at FBI Headquarters, in Washington, Oct. 28, 2013. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak, File)2026-02-13T19:49:26Z\n                                        NEW YORK (AP) — Goldman Sachs general counsel Kathy Ruemmler has had a storied legal career. As a federal prosecutor, she helped successfully prosecute Enron executives including Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling. She was part of President Barack Obama’s administration, working in various roles for much of his two terms in office, including as White House Counsel.She was even briefly considered by President Obama as a candidate for Attorney General.On Thursday, Ruemmler, 54, announced that she plans to resign from the top legal post at Goldman after a trove of emails and correspondence between her and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein showed the two individuals were especially close, years after Epstein’s 2008 conviction on sex crimes charges, when he became a registered sex offender. Ruemmler previously downplayed her relationship with Epstein. She called him a “monster” and said she regretted ever knowing him. Ruemmler has repeatedly described their relationship as professional, citing her job as a private defense attorney before she ever joined Goldman Sachs.\n    \n        \n    \n\nBut documents released in recent weeks and reviewed by The Associated Press depict a deeper relationship than had previously been characterized by Ruemmler and Goldman Sachs. These included intimate email exchanges, social plans and gifts that went beyond formal legal work. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n\nRoughly 8,400 documents involved Ruemmler or referenced her. Some correspondence shows that Ruemmler was aware of the extent of the allegations that Epstein had faced involving underage girls in Florida. In some instances, she advised Epstein on how he might go about trying to repair his image and defend himself publicly against new claims of misconduct.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe gifts Epstein gave to Ruemmler have been documented in news reports: the spa treatments, the handbags from Hermes, an Apple Watch, a Fendi coat, among many others. But some of the interactions between Epstein and Ruemmler described throughout their correspondence indicates that Epstein and Ruemmler did not simply have a lawyer-client transactional relationship, as Ruemmler previously attested to.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“It makes him happy to see you happy,” Epstein’s assistant wrote to Ruemmler in 2016, after Epstein prepaid for a spa treatment for her.In October 2018, Epstein directed one of his assistants to send flowers and chicken soup to Ruemmler because she has “not been feeling well.” It would not be the first time that Epstein would send her a small token of appreciation when she was sick. They talked about dating issues, made jokes about both the wealthy and everyday people, and shared laments about their careers and dating lives.They would message each other about mundane things like their mutual distaste for seeing babies in business class on flights and would repeatedly plan to have dinner or drinks in various places. Epstein even had Ruemmler as a backup executor of his will at one point.Setting aside the immense wealth and privilege and Epstein’s legal troubles, many of the emails between the two would look no different from the banter that many Americans would share to in their own text messages, emails or group chats.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“Well, I adore him. It’s like having another older brother!” she wrote in an email in 2015.During her time in private practice after she left the White House in 2014, Ruemmler received several expensive gifts from Epstein, including luxury handbags and a fur coat. The gifts were given after Epstein had already been convicted of sex crimes in 2008 and was registered as a sex offender. Ruemmler was also involved in Epstein’s legal defense efforts after he was arrested a second time for sex crimes in 2019 and later killed himself in a Manhattan jail.“So lovely and thoughtful! Thank you to Uncle Jeffrey!!!” Ruemmler wrote to Epstein in 2018. She later joined Goldman Sachs in 2020 and became the investment bank’s top lawyer in 2021.The firm’s leadership backed her publicly amid the revelations. But the embarrassing emails raised questions about Ruemmler’s judgment. Historically, Wall Street frowns on gift-giving between clients and bankers or Wall Street lawyers, particularly high-end gifts that could pose a conflict of interest. Goldman Sachs requires its employees to get pre-approval before receiving gifts from or giving them to clients, according to the company’s code of conduct, partly in order to not run afoul of anti-bribery laws.\n    \n        \n    \n\nBloomberg News, The Wall Street Journal and other media outlets reported that Goldman’s partners, who are the firms most senior and well-regarded members of the firm going back to when the investment bank was privately held, had begun to question why the firm was holding Ruemmler in such high regard when other lawyers were just as qualified to hold the top legal job.In her statement Thursday, Ruemmler said: “Since I joined Goldman Sachs six years ago, it has been my privilege to help oversee the firm’s legal, reputational, and regulatory matters; to enhance our strong risk management processes; and to ensure that we live by our core value of integrity in everything we do. My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs’ interests first.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nGoldman CEO David Solomon he respected Ruemmler’s decision to resign.

        "title": "Brazilian au pair gets 10-year sentence for scheme to kill lover’s wife and another man",
        "text": "Juliana Peres Magalhães testifies during the double murder trial for Brendan Banfield in Fairfax County Circuit Court, Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026, in Fairfax, Va. (AP Photo/Tom Brenner, Pool)2026-02-13T05:01:41Z\n                                        RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — An au pair who schemed with her employer-turned-lover to kill his wife and another man received a 10-year sentence on Friday.Prosecutors had recommended immediate release for Juliana Peres Magalhães in exchange for her guilty plea to a downgraded manslaughter charge in the February 2023 killing of Joseph Ryan. She testified that she fatally shot Ryan as Brendan Banfield was fatally stabbing his wife, Christine, in the couple’s bedroom.Instead, the judge delivered the maximum possible sentence to the woman from Brazil.“I know my remorse cannot bring you peace,” Magalhães said to the victims’ families. “I lost myself in a relationship, and left my morals and values behind.”Fairfax Chief Circuit Court Judge Penney S. Azcarate showed little mercy. “Let’s get it straight: You do not deserve anything other than incarceration and a life of reflection on what you have done to the victim and his family. May it weigh heavily on your soul,” the judge said.\n    \n        \n    \n\nMagalhães had remained silent for months before agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors in their case against Brendan Banfield, who was convicted by a jury this month of aggravated murder in the deaths of his wife and Ryan. Prosecutors said they continued their affair for months after the killings.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nAt his trial, Magalhães testified that she and Banfield, an IRS agent, had created an account in the name of his wife, a pediatric intensive care nurse, on a social media platform for people interested in sexual fetishes. Ryan connected with the account and agreed to meet for a sexual encounter involving a knife. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nMagalhães said she and Brendan Banfield took the couple’s 4-year-old child to the basement, and then entered the bedroom, where she said Brendan Banfield shot Ryan and was stabbing his wife in the neck. When she saw Ryan moving, Magalhães said, she fired the second shot that killed him.\n    \n        \n    \n\nShe wasn’t arrested until eight months later, and didn’t talk with investigators for more than a year, until she changed her mind as her own trial date approached.Banfield’s attorney scrutinized the former au pair’s motives during his trial, arguing that she was only saying what prosecutors wanted to hear. As part of her plea deal, her attorney and prosecutors agreed to end her time behind bars at her sentencing hearing. Chief Judge Penney Azcarate could still reject that agreement. In Virginia, manslaughter is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                OLIVIA DIAZ\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Diaz covers Virginia politics with the Associated Press.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto",

        "title": "Minnesotans welcome the immigration surge drawdown but remain vigilant",
        "text": "White House border czar Tom Homan holds a news conference at the Bishop Whipple Federal building on Thursday, Feb. 12, 2026 in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Steve Karnowski)2026-02-13T18:03:49Z\n                                        MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Trump administration’s drawdown of its immigration enforcement surge in the Twin Cities area has been met with relief, but state officials and residents say its effects on Minnesota’s economy and immigrant communities will linger.Thousands of officers were sent to the Minneapolis and St. Paul area for Operation Metro Surge, which the Department of Homeland Security called its “ largest immigration enforcement operation ever \" and touted as a success. But President Donald Trump’s enforcement campaign came under increasing criticism and pushback as the situation grew increasingly volatile. The shooting deaths of U.S. citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers drew condemnation and raised questions over officers’ conduct, prompting changes to the operation.And despite the announced end to the surge, Democratic Gov. Tim Walz urged Minnesotans to remain vigilant.\n    \n        \n    \n\nDrawdown after improved coordinationBorder czar Tom Homan told reporters Thursday that “extensive engagement” with state and local officials allowed for a formal end to the operation.Trump dispatched Homan to de-escalate tensions after the Jan. 24 killing of Pretti. Homan said a drawdown would be predicated on the level of cooperation the federal agencies received from state and local officials.That cooperation came to pass, particularly with state and local law enforcement and jails’ handling of deportable inmates, Homan said. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nBut he also said he made various internal changes since arriving, including changing certain personnel, deploying body cameras and communicating that misconduct by immigration officers would not be tolerated.“There were some issues here. We fixed those issues,” Homan said. “We’ve had great success with this operation and we’re leaving Minnesota safer.”\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nImmigration enforcement will continue, but with a smaller footprintHoman announced last week that 700 federal officers would leave Minnesota immediately, but that still left more than 2,000 in the state. He said Thursday that a “significant drawdown” was already underway and would continue through next week.Homan said he would be on the ground for a “little longer” to oversee the drawdown, and that a small team would facilitate the transition and ensure the continuing cooperation of state and local authorities.He did not specify how many officers would remain, but he said targeted enforcement would continue in the Twin Cities.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“President Trump made a promise of mass deportation, and that’s what this country is going to get,” Homan said.Todd Lyons, Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s acting director, said during a congressional hearing Thursday that the agency is still searching for about 16,840 people in Minnesota who have final orders of removal.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe operation leaves its mark on the Twin Cities Following Homan’s announcement Thursday, some residents held a vigil at a makeshift shrine that went up where Good was shot in Minneapolis.“I don’t even want one ICE person here, if they act the way they’ve been acting,” said local attendee John Schnickel. “Does it fade away if they leave here? Are they going somewhere else, or has the country and the White House learned a lesson?”He also disagreed with remarks by Trump officials that the enforcement surge made Minnesota safer. “They talk about how the murder rate is down, and yet they’ve added two people to it,” he said.Mark Foresman, an attendee from the suburb of St. Louis Park, said he is skeptical that the agents will leave.“The Trump administration has created an atmosphere of distrust for government in general, so that’s caused citizens like myself to not believe what they say, because they’ve repeatedly been caught in lies,” he said, suggesting the Trump administration’s tactics seemed designed to stir up publicity and sow fear.Juan Uvera, who was visiting from New York City, said one thing that jumped out to him was the number of businesses that were closed or had signs barring ICE.“From afar, on TV, it’s just like people are getting shot and killed. But you actually see the effect it has on the people over here,” he said.Anna Van Sice, an attendee who was wearing one of the commonplace whistles that have been used in immigration crackdown cities to warn that federal officers are nearby, said the Twin Cities area can’t let its guard down and that will keep responding to ICE’s presence.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“We don’t have a lot, or any trust in the government right now,” she said. “I guess I’ll believe it when I see it.”____Fingerhut reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

        "title": "Journalist Don Lemon is set to be arraigned in Minnesota church protest case",
        "text": "Journalist Don Lemon enters the courthouse in St. Paul, Minn., on Friday, Feb. 13, 2026. (AP Photo/Mark Vancleave)2026-02-13T05:10:38Z\n                                        ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Former CNN host turned independent journalist Don Lemon and four other people are set to be arraigned on federal civil rights charges Friday, accused in a protest at a Minnesota church where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is a pastor.Lemon did not comment to reporters as he entered the courthouse. Also scheduled for arraignment Friday is civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong. The prominent local activist was the subject of a doctored photo posted on official White House social media that falsely showed her crying during her arrest. The picture is part of a deluge of AI-altered imagery that has circulated since the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers in Minneapolis amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.Lemon’s attorney, Joe Thompson, did not return calls this week seeking comment. Arraignments in federal court typically include the entering of pleas and scheduling of future proceedings. Lemon has said he plans to plead not guilty.\n    \n        \n    \n\nTwo more defendants accused in the protest at a Southern Baptist church in St. Paul are scheduled for arraignment next week, including another independent journalist, Georgia Fort. Nine people have been charged in the case.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nProtesters interrupted a service at Cities Church on Jan. 18 by chanting “ICE out” and “Justice for Renee Good,” referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis last month. Lemon has said he is not affiliated with the group and that he was there as a journalist to chronicle the event for his livestream show.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n“I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now. In fact, there is no more important time than right now, this very moment for a free and independent media that shines a light on the truth and holds those in power accountable,” Lemon told reporters after his arrest. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe church protest drew sharp complaints from conservative religious and political leaders. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned in a social media post: “President Trump will not tolerate the intimidation and harassment of Christians in their sacred places of worship.” Even clergy who oppose the administration’s immigration enforcement tactics expressed discomfort.All nine are charged under the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which prohibits interference or intimidation of “any person by force, threat of force, or physical obstruction exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.” Penalties can range up to a year in prison and up to a $10,000 fine.Thompson is one of several former prosecutors who have left the Minnesota U.S. Attorney’s Office in recent weeks citing frustration with the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement crackdown in the state and the Justice Department’s response to the killing of Good and Pretti.One of four lawyers registered to represent Lemon, Thompson had led the sprawling investigation of major public program fraud cases for the prosecutors office until he resigned last month. The Trump administration has cited the fraud cases, in which most defendants have come from the state’s large Somali community, as justification for its immigration crackdown.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                STEVE KARNOWSKI\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Karnowski covers politics and government from Minnesota for The Associated Press.

        "title": "TryEngineering Marks 20 Years of Getting Kids Interested in STEM",
        "text": "IEEE TryEngineering is celebrating 20 years of empowering educators with resources that introduce engineering to students at an early age. Launched in 2006 as a collaboration between IEEE, IBM, and the New York Hall of Science (NYSCI), TryEngineering began with a clear goal: Make engineering accessible, understandable, and engaging for students and the teachers who support them.What started as an idea within IEEE Educational Activities has grown into a global platform supporting preuniversity engineering education around the world.Concerns about the futureIn the early 2000s, engineering was largely absent from preuniversity education, typically being taught only in small, isolated programs. Most students had little exposure to the many types of engineering, and they did not learn what engineers actually do.At the same time, industry and academic leaders were increasingly concerned about the future of engineering as a whole. They worried about the talent pipeline and saw existing outreach efforts as scattered and inconsistent.In 2004 representatives from several electrical and computer engineering industries met with IEEE leadership and expressed their concerns about the declining number of students interested in engineering careers. They urged IEEE to organize a more effective, coordinated response to unite professional societies, educators, and industry around a shared approach to preuniversity outreach and education.One of the major recommendations to come out of that meeting was to start teaching youngsters about engineering earlier. Research from the U.S. National Academy of Engineering at the time showed that students begin forming attitudes toward science, technology, engineering, and math fields from ages 5 to 10, and that outreach should begin as early as kindergarten. Waiting until the teen years or university-level education is simply too late, they determined; it needs to happen during the formative years to spark long-term interest in STEM learning.The idea behind the websiteTryEngineering emerged from the broader Launching Our Children’s Path to Engineering initiative, which was approved in 2005 by the IEEE Board of Directors. A core element of the IEEE program was a public-facing website that would introduce young learners to engineering projects, roles, and careers. The concept eventually developed into TryEngineering.org.The idea for TryEngineering.org itself grew from an existing, successful model. The NYSCI operated TryScience.org, a popular public website supported by IBM that helped students explore science topics through hands-on activities and real‑world connections.At the time, the IEEE Educational Activities group was working with the NYSCI on TryScience projects. Building a parallel site focused on engineering was a natural next step, and IBM’s experience in supporting large‑scale educational outreach made it a strong partner.A central figure in turning that vision into reality was Moshe Kam, who served as the 2005–2007 IEEE Educational Activities vice president, and later as the 2011 IEEE president. During his tenure, Kam spearheaded the creation of TryEngineering.org and guided the international expansion of IEEE’s Teacher In‑Service Program, which trained volunteers to work directly with teachers to create hands-on engineering lessons (the program no longer exists). His leadership helped establish preuniversity education as a core, long‑term priority within IEEE.“The founders of the IEEE TryEngineering program created something very special. In a world where the messaging about becoming an engineer often scares students who have not yet developed math skills away from our profession, and preuniversity teachers without engineering degrees have trepidation in teaching topics in our fields of interest, people like Dr. Kam and the other founders had a vision where everyone could literally try engineering,” says Jamie Moesch, IEEE Educational Activities managing director. “Because of this, teachers have now taught millions of our hands-on lessons and opened our profession to so many more young minds,” he adds. “All of the preuniversity programs we have continued to build and improve upon are fueled by this massively important and simple-to-understand concept of try engineering.”A focus on educatorsFrom the beginning, TryEngineering focused on educators as the keys to its success, rather than starting with students. Instead of complex technical explanations, the platform offered free, classroom-ready lesson plans with clear explanations about engineering fields and examples with which students could relate. Hands-on activities emphasized problem‑solving, creativity, and teamwork—core elements of how engineers actually work.IEEE leaders also recognized that misconceptions about engineering discouraged many talented young people—particularly girls and students from underrepresented groups—from pursuing engineering as a career. TryEngineering aimed to show engineering as practical, creative, and connected to real-world needs, helping students see that engineering could be for anyone, not just a narrow group of specialists.By simply encouraging students and educators to just try engineering, doors are open to new possibilities and a broader understanding of the field. Even students who ultimately choose other career paths get to learn key concepts, such as the engineering design process, equipping them with practical skills for the rest of their life.Outreach programs and summer campsDuring the past two decades, TryEngineering has grown well beyond its original website. In addition to providing a vast library of lesson plans and resources that engage and inspire, it also serves as the hub for a collection of programs reaching educators and students in many ways.Those include the TryEngineering STEM Champions program, which empowers dedicated volunteers to support outreach programs and serve as vital connectors to IEEE’s extensive resources. The TryEngineering Summer Institute offers immersive campus‑based experiences for students ages 13 to 17, with expanded locations and programs being introduced this year.The IEEE STEM Summit is an annual virtual event that brings together educators and volunteers from around the world. TryEngineering OnCampus partners with universities around the globe to organize hands-on programs. TryEngineering educator sessions provide free professional development programs aligned with emerging industry needs such as semiconductors.20 ways to celebrate 20 yearsTo mark its 20th anniversary, TryEngineering is celebrating with a year of special activities, new partnerships, and fresh resources for educators. Visit the TryEngineering 20th Anniversary collection page to explore what’s ahead, join the celebration, and discover 20 ways to celebrate 20 years of inspiring the next generation of technology innovators. This is an opportunity to reflect on how far the program has come, and to help shape how the next generation discovers engineering.“The passion and dedication of the thousands of volunteers of IEEE who do local outreach enables the IEEE-wide goal to inspire intellectual curiosity and invention to engage the next generation of technology innovators,” Moesch says. “The first 20 years have been special, and I cannot wait to have the world experience what the future holds for the TryEngineering programs.”",

        "text": "SummaryThe New Museum in New York is set to open New Humans: Memories of the FutureOpening on March 21, the expansion's inaugural showcase features over 700 that reimagine the relationship between humanity and technologyIn an era drunk on algorithmic prophecy, the presence (and fear) of the mechanized nonhuman is ever-present. Yet with every new technology that comes our way, we’re forced to face the same question that artists and scientists have been wrestling with for centuries: what does it mean to be human?With excitement high for the long-anticipated reveal of the New Museum’s OMA-designed expansion, the institution has announced the full artist list for its expansive comeback show, New Humans: Memories of the Future. A fitting theme for the newly revamped building, the exhibition explores an obsession with mechanical, biological and spiritual invention through the lens of 230 artists, writers, scientists architects and filmmakers.From the nightmarish distortions of H.R. Giger and Francis Bacon to cyborg lifeforms from contemporary makers, like Cao Fei, Hito Steyerl, Lee Bul and Meriem Bennani, the exhibition resists the myth of linear progress, staging itself as a “series of leaps, returns and reversals” across time. The avant-garde’s “New Man” and “New Woman,” for example, prefigure our contemporary obsession with augmented bodies, optimized selves and digital avatars. Surreal provocations have always mapped bodies under pressure.A future belongs to everyone, luddites and techno-optimists all the same. If humans have met their technological match, New Humans suggests we’ve been rehearsing the encounter for over a century. Perhaps the real disruption isn’t a digital one, but an enduring dream to reinvent the human altogether.New Humans: Memories of the Future is set to open on March 21.

        "title": "Let Carolina Sarria Dress Your Alter-Ego",
        "text": "From immigrating to New York City in pursuit of an artistic career more than 20 years ago, to landing her own Vogue Italia cover and a Warhol Foundation partnership, Carolina Sarria’s rise to prominence has been fueled by an uncompromising commitment to her vision. The Colombian artist and designer describes her process as a balance of contradictions, where opposite qualities meet and mix. Her collections often start with her handmade art, but she also welcomes technology with open arms. Sarria’s eponymous label is highly personal, drawing from her own interests and artistic whims, but she also has a trusted team to tailor her ideas. She appreciates the weight of tradition, but ultimately believes in the necessity of subversion.“My mindset is a bit punk, so there’s no such thing as a ‘basic’ material for me, just as there is no such thing as a ‘precious’ material,” she shared with Hypebeast during a visit to her studio. “Nothing is sacred.” Like her collage approach to design, she has gathered diverse inspiration from NYC’s artistic community, historical countercultures, and themes of modern excess. Her latest FW26 collection, “Poker Face,” is no exception, featuring everything from gambling motifs to poker pieces and origami dollar bills. In conversation with Hypebeast, Sarria expanded on her dynamic creative practice and opened up about her core values as a “nonconformist” designer. How do you define yourself as an artist, and what does your initial creative process look like?I consider myself a multidisciplinary artist. I don't really start thinking about the garment; I start thinking about art. I also go around to collect a lot of images and found items. That’s probably one of the most fun things for me to do. Once I have the idea, I start gathering things together and putting them on the walls. I love the juxtaposition of things. What excites me the most is the contradiction — it always speaks. I always want to see a surprise, so I start adding together, manipulating, and adding more until I create a mixed media piece.What inspired your new collection, \"Poker Face,” and how does it relate to your style?My mindset is a bit punk, so there’s no such thing as a \"basic\" material for me, just as there is no such thing as a \"precious\" material. Nothing is sacred. In my mood board for \"Poker Face,\" I’m playing with real U.S. currency. I make them into origami symbols and incorporate them into the collection. You’ll see poker chips, poker cards, and spikes.For this collection, I had a time in my life that was very decadent, messy, and indulgent. The excesses of Las Vegas, the long nights that are an outlet for many people — I took all that and froze the moment in time, the feeling. All the pieces will have this [AR] tag, and you'll be able to trigger the tag with a jackpot game. If you hit the jackpot in one of your items, you'll get another item for free — anyone you want. I made it very dynamic. I wanted to make collecting part of the clothing, that you can actually take your object and have it rise as a part of a memory. \"My mindset is a bit punk, so there’s no such thing as a \"basic\" material for me, just as there is no such thing as a \"precious\" material. Nothing is sacred.You often use trench coats in your collections. Why that specific garment?Trench coats are so closely tied to tradition, not just in clothing, but a traditional lifestyle. To me, that’s the perfect canvas. I take the art and apply it to the trench coats as a way of challenging societal expectations and turning them on their head. One of the first things that inspired me about a trench is how classic and timeless it feels. It’s one of the oldest traditional silhouettes to exist, and that’s what is so meaningful.Who is the client you have in mind when you are designing?I dress musicians, rappers, rockers — the young generation — but I think I really design for the man who likes to take his alter ego out for a stroll, even if he’s just going to the deli and coming back.Can you tell us about your collaboration with the Warhol Foundation?After the collaboration, I met the president of the foundation. They told me that my collaboration was one of the favorites of the foundation. We became really good friends, and he’s now one of my best friends.That was a very meaningful collaboration for me. I had that collaboration for about two and a half years. They gave me real Andy Warhol images, and I restored them, which was very exciting for me. I did mixed media on them, adding colors, textures, and burning them. They became collages and then clothing.As a creative person, you always need a powerful team and people who believe in what you do. It’s like the mixed media situation where it all makes a composition and goes together. How do you know when you’re done?I never know. I have people who come and edit me; someone to come in here and say, \"This is when we stop.\" They create the edited edition, taking 50 pieces and bringing them down to 22, because otherwise, I’ll never stop.As a creative person, you always need a powerful team and people who believe in what you do. It’s like the mixed media situation where it all makes a composition and goes together. That’s when it’s successful. It is not just because of me; it’s because of my team and the people that work with me, too.You also have a collection inspired by the Yakuza. What drew you to that theme?Tattoos are something that brands you forever, that people have on their bodies forever. When I was investigating, I found that they are much more than just tattoos. They have meaning — strength, loyalty, identity. What really interested me was that they hide them and wear them under the clothing. I thought, what if I give them a life outside? So that's what I did, enabling them to wear these tattoos and symbols. I love tattoos. I don't have any tattoos, but I would love to wear something that feels like a tattoo or put stickers on my body and then take them off because I'm always constantly changing my mind. I believe in staying true to what you feel and to self-expression. I will not be quiet. I will always speak and express myself in any layer, form, or tool.What is a typical day like in the studio for you?It can be me making a moodboard with all of my materials, designing a whole collection, or managing everybody on my phone and computer all day. It gets very hectic when I'm designing. Sometimes I have this state of mind — very hyper-focused for many days, weeks, months.I also have the team come here. Some days it's the tech team, sometimes people are here airbrushing, doing embroideries, beading, and making samples. I like to do the samples here, like the collage for the trench coat. We do a lot of these things here — patches combined from the casino newspaper and rock and roll. It’s very important to continue the craftsmanship.We use a lot of tools, from flame guns to an airbrush and a sewing machine. A tool that I also love to use is AI. It helps me catch up with life. I use it to put my designs on models to see the styling and the vision. I like that I'm able to bring the virtual world and then go back to the real world.Finally, what would you say is your \"North Star\" as an artist?I’m very attracted to the opposite, the contradiction, and the juxtaposition of things — the nonconformist and counterculture. Like the Yakuza, they have their own beliefs and symbolism. They are so true to what they believe and their identity. That’s powerful. I'm a nonconformist, and I believe in peace and love, in art, in design, and in community. I believe in staying true to what you feel and to self-expression. I will not be quiet. I will always speak and express myself in any layer, form, or tool. My North Star could be self-expression. I want to say what the fuck I want to. It could cost my life, but this is who I am and what I have to say.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "People protest against President Donald Trump&#x27;s policy towards Greenland in front of U..S consulate in Nuuk, Greenland, Jan. 17, 2026. (AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka, File)2026-02-13T12:03:29Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans may be willing to stick with President Donald Trump through almost anything, but his recent push to seize control of Greenland has turned off many in his own party, according to a new AP-NORC poll.The survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that about 7 in 10 U.S. adults disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. That’s higher than the share who dislike how he’s handling foreign policy generally, suggesting that Trump’s Greenland approach has created a weak spot for the administration. About 24% of American adults approve of Trump’s Greenland approach. Even Republicans aren’t thrilled. About half disapprove of his attempt to turn the icebound landmass into American territory, something that Trump has insisted is critical for national security in the Arctic, while about half approve.The poll was conducted Feb. 5-8, which is after Trump had made the decision to scrap tariffs designed to pressure European countries into supporting U.S. control of Greenland, but after his weekslong push for American intervention over the island.\n    \n        \n    \n\nAbout half of Republicans disapprove of Trump on GreenlandTrump’s base is normally unwavering behind him, so Greenland stands out as an exception. The marks represent Trump’s lowest ratings among Republicans on a list of key issues in the poll, including the economy and immigration — where about 8 in 10 approve — and foreign policy generally. About 7 in 10 Republicans approve of his overall foreign policy approach.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nTrump has argued that the U.S. needs Greenland to counter threats from Russia and China in the Arctic region, despite America already having a military presence there.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nOther recent polls, including a Pew Research Center survey conducted in January, found that Republicans were largely divided on whether the U.S. should take over Greenland, while Americans overall were opposed.\n    \n        \n    \n\nAyman Amir, a 46-year-old Trump supporter from Houston, Texas, said he agrees that Greenland holds strategic importance for the United States’ military. But that doesn’t mean he thinks Trump should claim it. “We can’t take it by force. We don’t have a right to do that,” Amir said. “You can’t blame Russia for what they do in Ukraine and then do the same thing. You can’t do this.”Trump’s overall foreign policy approval remains steadyThe president dropped his threats to seize the territory by force late last month after saying a framework for a deal over access to Greenland was reached with help from NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. The clash represents just one of the moves Trump has made to strain relationships with key allies over the last year. Western leaders are focusing on trans-Atlantic tensions this week at the Munich Security Conference. On Greenland, Trump has few vocal supporters at home or abroad.Even as Trump made significant moves to obtain control of Greenland, his overall approval on the issue of foreign policy has remained steady. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of Trump’s approach to foreign policy, a measure that’s been unchanged in recent months.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nYoung Republicans especially disapprove of Greenland approach\n    \n        \n    \n\nYounger Republicans are especially likely to disapprove of how Trump is handling the situation.About 6 in 10 Republicans under 45 say they disapprove of his leadership on Greenland, compared to about 4 in 10 older Republicans. \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThat 4 in 10 who approve of Trump’s Greenland actions is much lower than young Republicans’ approval on issues of foreign policy, the economy, or immigration.Independent voter Aaron Gunnoe, 29, an engineer from Marion, Ohio, was baffled by Trump’s aggressive posture on the NATO ally.“It’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard,” he said. “It’s owned by somebody else. That should be the end of it.” ___The AP-NORC poll of 1,156 adults was conducted Feb. 5-8 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. The margin of sampling error for Republicans overall is plus or minus 6.1 percentage points.\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                LINLEY SANDERS\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Sanders is a polls and surveys reporter for The Associated Press.

        "title": "Inflation measure falls to nearly five-year low as gas prices fall and housing costs cool",
        "text": "A shopper looks at produce at a grocery store Tuesday, Feb. 10, 2026, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Erin Hooley)2026-02-13T05:01:36Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — A key measure of inflation fell to nearly a five-year low last month as apartment rental price growth slowed and gas prices fell, offering some relief to Americans grappling with the sharp cost increases of the past five years. Inflation dropped to 2.4% in January compared with a year earlier, down from 2.7% in December and not too far from the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, rose just 2.5% in January from a year ago, down from 2.6% the previous month and the smallest increase since March 2021.Friday’s report suggests inflation is cooling, but it comes after the cost of food, gas, and apartment rents soared after the pandemic, with consumer prices about 25% higher than they were five years ago. The increase in such a broad range of costs has become a high-profile political issue under the rubric of “affordability.”\n    \n        \n    \n\nOn a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.2% in January from December, while core prices rose 0.3%. Core inflation was held down by a sharp drop in the price of used cars, which fell 1.8% just in January from December. \n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nGas prices fell 3.2% last month, the third drop in the past four months, and are down 7.5% from a year earlier. Grocery prices increased 0.2% in January, after a big 0.6% rise in December, and are up 2.1% from a year ago.If inflation gets closer to the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%, it could allow the central bank to cut its key short-term interest rate further this year, as Trump has repeatedly demanded. High borrowing costs for things like mortgages and auto loans have also contributed to a perception that many big-ticket items remain out of reach for many Americans.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nU.S. markets immediately reversed course early Friday and futures moved into positive territory. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which heavily influences mortgage rates, declined on the expectation that lower inflation will allow the Fed to cut rates. \n    \n        \n    \n\nInflation surged to 9.1% in 2022 as consumer spending soared at the same time supply chains snarled in the wake of the pandemic. It began to fall in 2023 but leveled off around 3% in mid-2024 and remained elevated last year. Inflation cooled a bit this fall, though some of that reflected the disruptions of the six-week government shutdown in October. The shutdown disrupted the government’s data collection and led them to estimate price changes in November for housing that most economists say artificially lowered inflation that month. At the same time, measures of wage growth have declined in the past year or so as hiring has cratered. With companies reluctant to add jobs, workers don’t have as much leverage to demand raises. Smaller pay increases can reduce inflationary pressures as companies often raise prices to offset higher wages. More modest wage growth is a big reason that many economists expect inflation to continue easing this year. “We’re not expecting inflation to start up again by any stretch,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist for Wilmington Trust. \n    \n        \n    \n\nMany businesses are still eating some tariff costs and economists expect they may raise prices more in the next few months to offset those extra expenses. Still, most forecast that inflation will decline further by the second half of the year and drop closer to the Fed’s 2% target by the end of 2026. \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                CHRISTOPHER RUGABER\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Rugaber has covered the Federal Reserve and the U.S. economy for the AP for 16 years.

        "text": "Los Angeles Clippers guard Chris Paul drives to the basket during the second half of an NBA basketball game against the Orlando Magic, Thursday, Nov. 20, 2025, in Orlando, Fla. (AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack, File)2026-02-13T18:34:36Z\n                                        Chris Paul, the “Point God” who was a 12-time All-Star selection and two-time Olympic gold medalist, announced his retirement on Friday in the capper of a 21-season career that will surely merit induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame.Paul made the announcement on the first day of the NBA’s All-Star weekend at the home of the Los Angeles Clippers in Inglewood, California. Paul spent his final season — an abbreviated one — with the Clippers, who sent him home in December and wound up trading him to Toronto earlier this month.The Raptors knew Paul would never play in Toronto, and that begged the question about whether the Wake Forest legend would try to finish the season with another team in pursuit of the thing he never got — an NBA title.The answer came Friday. He’s done. He said last summer that he has hated missing events with his children over the last few years, and now he can devote himself much more to his family and other interests.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“It’s time for me to show up for others and in other ways,” Paul wrote on a social media post, announcing the decision.He strongly hinted earlier this season that this year was going to be his last. Paul was a four-time All-NBA first team selection, and he ranks second in NBA history with 12,552 assists and 2,728 steals. He was the first player to score at least 20,000 points while recording at least 10,000 assists; LeBron James and Russell Westbrook have both since done that as well.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nPaul became arguably the most accomplished player in Clippers franchise history while leading the team to six winning seasons from 2011-17, including the Clippers’ first two Pacific Division titles and three playoff series victories. Paul returned to Los Angeles as a free agent last July, rejoining a franchise where he is loved by fans — but it went bad quickly, and Paul’s last game with the Clippers was Dec. 1.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nIt turned out to be his last NBA game, period.\n    \n        \n    \n\n“While this chapter of being an ‘NBA player’ is done, the game of basketball will forever be engrained in the DNA of my life, spanning three decades,” Paul wrote. “It’s crazy even saying that!! Playing basketball for a living has been an unbelievable blessing that also came with lost of responsibility. I embraced it all.”Paul is one of seven players to have an NBA career span at least 21 seasons. And he’s already in the Hall of Fame: the 2008 Olympic ‘Redeem Team’ was enshrined as part of the 2025 class. It won’t be long before he goes in on his own as well.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                TIM REYNOLDS\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Reynolds is an Associated Press sports writer, based in South Florida.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto",

(AP Photo/Stefanie Dazio)2026-02-13T09:55:14Z\n                                        CORTINA D’AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Ukrainian skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych lost an appeal of his disqualification from the Milan Cortina Olympics on Friday, yet already knew there was no pathway for him to compete in the race.The Court of Arbitration for Sport denied the appeal, agreeing with the International Olympic Committee and the sliding sport’s federation that Heraskevych’s plan to wear a helmet showing the faces of more than 20 Ukrainian coaches and athletes killed since Russia invaded their country four years ago would be in violation of Olympic rules.CAS, in a brief statement, said the sole arbitrator who heard the case had no choice but to side with IOC policy about what athletes at an Olympics can say on a field of play — and that the “memory helmet” Heraskevych brought to the Milan Cortina Games would not align with the rules athletes have to follow.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe arbitrator, CAS said, “found these limitations reasonable and proportionate, considering the other opportunities for athletes to raise awareness in mixed zones, in press conferences, on social networks, or in Mr. Heraskevych’s case, wearing the helmet during four training runs.”\n\n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nCAS added that the arbitrator “wished to state that she is fully sympathetic to Mr. Heraskevych’s commemoration and to his attempt to raise awareness for the grief and devastation suffered by the Ukrainian people, and Ukrainian athletes because of the war.”___AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n      \n   \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                TIM REYNOLDS\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Reynolds is an Associated Press sports writer, based in South Florida.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto",

        "text": "Though some may be itching for the hints of spring, Michelob ULTRA is closing out the 2026 Winter Sports with a bang. With the final stretch of the Winter Sports closing out in Italy, the beer purveyor is gearing up for an exciting activation bringing fans together to celebrate iconic moments on the ice. On January 15, the brand kicked things off with the immersive “Run Back the Miracle” activation, which reimagined a formative moment on ice during the 1980 Winter Sports in Lake Placid, New York, when captain Mike Eruzione, goalie Jim Craig, and goalscorer Mark Johnson would lead the United States to victory against the Soviet Union. Now, the brand is back for an activation in Park City, Utah, that blends nostalgia with good-old-fashioned sports fandom.As the official beer sponsor of USA Hockey, Michelob ULTRA pays homage to the superior sportsmanship and grit demonstrated by NHL athletes in the “Home Team” commercial, spotlighting the impressive roster of U.S. Olympians championing Team USA. With history-making hockey pros returning to the arena since 2014, Michelob ULTRA is commemorating this moment by partnering with USA Hockey athletes, brothers (and St. Louis natives) Brady and Matthew Tkachuk. The two are making their Winter Sports debut as part of the 2026 U.S. Men’s Ice Hockey Team, with Michelob ULTRA spotlighting their journeys to the ice.Next up, the brand is hitting the slopes at the ULTRA Summit powered by TCL, where immersive programming will celebrate the Winter Sports up until the closing ceremony. ULTRA Summit's curated fan exhibition, the Pop-Up Exhibition of Winter Olympic and Paralympic Artifacts, will feature Team USA Archives from the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (including a USA Hockey jersey signed by “Miracle on Ice” gold medalist Mike Eruzione). The activation will also include après-ski Winter Sports watch parties, interactive games, puzzles, limited-edition merch and giveaways, and night skiing for fans looking to put their blades to the test. Keeping things electric, Norwegian artist-producer Kygo will keep spirits high with a live performance, following his legacy as the first-ever EDM artist to perform at the Olympic Games Rio 2016.In 2024, Michelob ULTRA became the Official Beer Sponsor of Team USA. Speaking to the brand’s commitment to spotlighting the excellence in sports and the communities that power ground-making moments, the Tkachuk brothers shared the following: “When it comes to the honor of representing Team USA on the ice, and on this stage, it’s a dream come true for us. It’s all about pushing yourself and your teammates to be your best and making your country proud. Michelob ULTRA, a brand from our hometown, applies that same competitive spirit to what they do, and we couldn’t be more excited to bring that energy back to the international stage.”To top off the momentum, Michelob ULTRA has teamed up with Hypebeast and sportswear brand SHRED, to develop limited-edition items. The special collaborations toast to a modern fanbase tuning into the Winter Sports, marrying Michelob ULTRA’s heritage colors and logos in sleek, modern designs.Visit Michelob ULTRA’s website for a chance to attend ULTRA Summit.

        "text": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth speaks at the Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, Monday, Feb. 9, 2026. (AP Photo/Patrick Whittle)2026-02-14T01:16:30Z\n                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military said Friday that it has carried out another deadly strike on a vessel accused of trafficking drugs in the Caribbean Sea.U.S. Southern Command said on social media that the boat “was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Caribbean and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations.” It said the strike killed three people. A video linked to the post shows a boat moving through the water before exploding in flames.Friday’s attack raises the death toll from the Trump administration’s strikes on alleged drug boats to 133 people in at least 38 attacks carried out since early September in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declared last week that “some top cartel drug-traffickers” in the region “have decided to cease all narcotics operations INDEFINITELY due to recent (highly effective) kinetic strikes in the Caribbean.” However, Hegseth did not provide any details or information to back up this claim, made in a post on his personal account on social media. President Donald Trump has said the U.S. is in “armed conflict” with cartels in Latin America and has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs. But his administration has offered little evidence to support its claims of killing “narcoterrorists.” \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n\n\n\n                    \n    获取更多RSS：https://feedx.net https://feedx.site",

        "title": "Chilling images from Nancy Guthrie’s porch could hold valuable clues about the masked suspect",
        "text": "This combo from images provided by the FBI shows surveillance footage at the home of Nancy Guthrie the night she went missing in Tucson, Ariz. (FBI via AP)2026-02-13T19:36:07Z\n                                        The chilling videos of a masked man outside Nancy Guthrie’s home in Arizona before she vanished show just glimpses of the suspect, but for investigators they hold a mountain of clues. And those images — from the suspect’s gloves to his flashlight — could be what’s needed to break the case. “There’s a tremendous amount of information that this guy left,” said former FBI profiler Clint Van Zandt.The FBI already has analyzed the videos from Guthrie’s doorbell camera to identify the suspect’s backpack, posting an alert on Thursday with a photo of the brand and model in hopes of narrowing down tips flooding the agency.It has been nearly two weeks since the mother of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie was believed to have been abducted.Former criminal investigators say it’s almost certain that authorities are building a physical and psychological profile of the suspect, using the footage released publicly on Tuesday that totals less than a minute. \n    \n        \n    \n\nWhether authorities recovered more footage isn’t known, but technology will allow them to see more than meets the eye.“Every single thing that is in the video is being digitally enhanced. Everything from the mask to backpack to the jacket,” said Ed Davis, the former Boston police commissioner during the marathon bombing and manhunt in 2013.Here’s what was captured in the footage and what clues each might yield: \n\nThe backpackIt probably didn’t take long to pinpoint the type of backpack the suspect was wearing, Davis said. Technology available today allows investigators to break down photos and videos to the pixel, he said, giving them images of the stitching and maybe the manufacturer or brand name.The FBI described the backpack as a black, 25-liter “Ozark Trail Hiker Pack.”\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n    \nThe holster The FBI says the man on Nancy Guthrie’s porch was armed. But the video shows he had an unusual holster setup, hanging over the middle of his waist and not on the side. It might be an indication that whoever it was has little experience with firearms. “I’ve never seen anything like that,” Davis said. \n    \n        \n    \n\nThe glovesThe footage gives a close-up view of the suspect trying to cover Guthrie’s doorbell camera, first with a gloved hand and then with part of a plant ripped from the yard. The black gloves appear to be thicker than most and shimmered in the light.“I spend a lot of time in Home Depot, and I’ve never seen those gloves,” Davis said. “They’re not very common.”The clothes The suspect’s zip-up jacket, pants, shoes and mask don’t immediately stand out. But identifying one or more of those items could be a key.Because once that happens, investigators can start looking at where those items are sold and combing through receipts and store surveillance cameras, starting with stores in the Tucson area closest to Guthrie’s home, said Van Zandt, who spent 25 years with the FBI.Going through mounds of receipts and footage will take time and isn’t something that would be done on most cases, but there’s no shortage of people assigned to this one, he said. The Pima County Sheriff’s Department earlier this week said several hundred detective and agents have been assigned to the case.“If all of the stars line up properly — and they rarely do — I find someone who was in there two weeks prior who bought the jacket, the shoes, the backpack all at the same time,” Van Zandt said.\n    \n        \n    \n\nThe flashlight In one of the videos, the suspect appeared to be holding a small flashlight in his mouth while in front of Guthrie’s door. Figuring out the type of flashlight might be difficult, but there’s something else to look at there, said David Lyons, a former homicide detective and police commander in Lexington, Kentucky.Not many people instinctively hold a flashlight in their mouth, but those who work in the trades might — such as an electrician or a plumber, he said. “That’s a small thing,” he said. “But at the same time, down the road, it could be something.” The movements Every step and movement the suspect made on the porch is worth a close look — from the way he walked, to how he seemed unhurried and how he grabbed the plant from the yard, Lyons said. All of that will likely be used by behavioral analysts to create a profile of the suspect, he said.“That’s what this will come down to,” Lyons said. “Those small aspects added all together.”\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                            \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                JOHN SEEWER\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Seewer covers state and national news for The Associated Press and is based in Toledo, Ohio.\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        twitter\n    \n\n\n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        mailto",

        "title": "Calvin Klein Collection FW26 Is Here for Hedonism",
        "text": "SummaryVeronica Leoni’s FW26 collection explores \"hedonistic elegance,\" blending reductionist geometry with opulence through sexy suiting, magnified fur, and architectural dresses.Drawing inspiration from 1970s archives and 1976 denim, the lineup strikes a balance between stark monochrome tailoring and indulgent textures, including leather, shearling, and translucent jackets.A year after bringing Calvin Klein Collection back to the runway with her FW25 debut, the creative director is honing in on her interpretation of the brand’s luxury arm. “Hedonistic elegance” is how Calvin Klein described Veronica Leoni’s FW26 Calvin Klein Collection. The simple statement conveys the mix of indulgent and austere elements that shape the line, which was presented at The Shed in NYC.Before Leoni, the brand was previously helmed by Raf Simons, under whom Leoni worked at Jil Sander. The designer’s additional experience at The Row and Celine (with Phoebe Philo) further informs her interpretation of Calvin Klein Collection, which has historically toed the line between urban expressivity and modern tailoring.All of those elements show their influence in the FW26 collection. Sexy suiting accentuated different parts of the body, fur collars were magnified to opulent proportions, and a “reductionist” lens highlighted the heightened geometry of the line. The collection also pays homage to the brand’s earlier days in the 70s and early ‘80s, where Leoni finds “danger in the obsessive quest for beauty.” View this post on InstagramA post shared by HYPEBEAST (@hypebeast) In particular, 1976 archival denim, the first ever on the Calvin Klein runway, was referenced with longhand logo embroidery on an aviator jacket. It was during this era that Brooke Shields (who was in attendance) famously fronted the brand’s controversial denim campaign.The show’s opening was led by black and white looks whose details were stripped back and simplified: a stark black suit with tonal pinstripes featured shrunken lapels, and a strapless, structured black dress looked almost seamless in execution. Then, speckled woolen coats, monochromatic all-leather suits, and shearling and leather collars heightened the mood to indulgence.Cutouts exposed the backsides of women’s jackets, while slim, sleeveless men’s blazers emphasized the arms. Sartorial fabrics were applied to simple yet architectural dresses, contrasting with richly draped numbers composed of supple fabrics. Standing out were translucent jackets in smoky red and taupe, echoing the gritty modernism of Raf Simons’ tenure.See the gallery above for a full look at Calvin Klein Collection FW26.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "For Fall/Winter 2026, Jane Wade clocked out. She's out of office; she's using her paid time off, and she's hitting the great outdoors.In the designer's Fall/Winter 2026 foray, formally entitled \"The Summit,\" Wade quit her day job, wavering from her traditional, highly cohesive corporate aesthetic and transitioning into an adventurous, adaptable archetype.\"The Jane Wade girl needs pieces that can be broken down and put back together in different ways,\" Wade shared in a post-show interview. \"They need to serve her in all facets of her life as she expresses herself differently.\"An escapist, what she calls \"Gorp-Corp\" envisioning of Wade's Pacific Northwest hometown, The Summit sought to emulate the ethos of Portland, also the hometown of this season's footwear partner, SOREL. The duo presented two collaborative models, the SOREL x Jane Wade Callsign Horizon™ Low and the  SOREL x Jane Wade Callsign™ Mule Shroud, on the runway, models – or shall I say, Ski Lift Operators, Avalanche Rescue, and Mountain Patrolers – pairing the tactical footwear with some of Wade's most daringly textured pieces yet.Upon stepping into the Brooklyn warehouse space, guests were transported to Wade's Oregon hometown, stepping into an immersive mountain setting, lined with Douglas Fir trees and patches of moss and ivy. \"I wanted to bring everyone home, into my home.\"  Attendees were greeted with Hydrojugs on the bench-style seating arrangements, along with Gotham Goods' new \"My Sweet Jane\" fragrance, which combines notes of smoked birch and oak moss.As always, at Jane Wade, the runway collection extends far beyond the runway. It's a whole world within the Jane Wade universe.Explore the collection in the gallery above and read our full interview with Jane Wade below. View this post on InstagramA post shared by HYPEBEAST (@hypebeast) Let's start at the beginning: the film that played before the runway started. Walk me through that. All of this is centered around the footwear collaboration with Sorel. Sorel is from Portland, and I'm from Portland, so I have a big connection to the brand. I grew up wearing the brand. When we asked if we could do the marketing campaign for it, I really had this huge idea that I wanted to fly my whole team out to Oregon, and shoot it in Oregon on Mount Hood. I used to go camping and hiking there. So we shot the film partially in Sorel's headquarters in Portland, and the other half of it, on-location on the mountain.The set design continues to build on this narrative as well. Could you say more about that component of the show? I wanted the set to be this distilled moment of the Pacific Northwest. There are ferns, Douglas Fir Trees, ivy, and moss. I wanted to bring everybody home into my home, where I grew up, and showcase that outdoorsy, transitional girly. I've been calling it \"Gorp Corp.\"Even down to the details, everything was so dialed in. What are some of your favorite subtleties of the collection?The casting was fun. There was one model who was the \"Avalanche Rescue\" character, and he was holding a rope and crampons for ice. My mom had an ice pick in her hair–– my mom walked the show!That was your mom!?Yes! My mom walked the show! She used to do fit modeling for Columbia Spotswear which is Sorel's parent company. So it was all so fun. She was in the campaign. She was the CEO, an evil person. This whole collection is about my childhood spirit.Tell me more about the textures and fabrics in this collection. In every collection, we continue to play with hand manipulations and textures. In the past few seasons, I've done yarn. I've done metal. This season, I really wanted to make the material paracord. So you see that theme throughout the commercial styles, and it shows up in small ways, like on pocketing and bungees, and then, you see the raw paracord material begin to build out the structured pieces later in the collection. We built all of those pieces in-house in our studio. It was really fun. It takes weeks and weeks to just make one of those, so it's a lot of focus and dedication to the craft. It was a really fun way to work in those embellishments and fabric manipulations in a totally different material universe.One last question: how does \"The Summit\" collection fit into the Jane Wade universe?I feel like there's always an umbrella theme of this girl trying to escape herself or uncover a new layer of herself, and for this season, it was the outdoor connection to nature. There's always an athletic layer to it, but it's definitely shaped around someone who is very multi-faceted and transitional. She needs pieces that can be broken down and put back together in different ways, and can serve her in different facets of her life as she expresses herself. So I'd say that's the parent theme, but in this collection, it was very outdoors-focused and forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "title": "Zamna Sends Waves Across Tulum With Biggest Festival Season Yet",
        "text": "Culture and hospitality group Zamna has just wrapped up its 2026 festival season in Tulum, Mexico. Welcoming back electronic music heavyweights David Guetta and Keinemusik as well as introducing new names to its roster, including Black Coffee and Rüfüs Du Sol, the 12-day program turned out to be the group's biggest – and perhaps boldest – event series to date. Having spent the last few years laying down its roots in the 11 hectare jungle, the latest edition saw Zamna pay homage to the surrounding Mayan backdrop with its high-octane event production. On the first night, partygoers closed the year out in an exotic-themed set featuring headliner and Afterlife founder MRAK, while later in the schedule, Mayan Warrior – a platform composed of Mexican artists – took their place in front of tribal-inspired architecture, blending deep sounds and glowing lights. Through tailoring each of the 10 events around Tulum’s heritage, the festival went on to attract 120,000 guests looking to experience its ethos “where music meets paradise.” The effects of the event were also seen across the vicinity of the coastal town as local bars, restaurants and clubs were reportedly booked out during the two weeks, while hotel occupancy skyrocketed up to 90%. Keeping the momentum going, the music group now reveals a new tourism trust called “Tulum All Year Round.” Building on its efforts in attracting over 100 nationalities to its events, the initiative will feature a 12-month calendar that incorporates cultural experiences for locals and visitors across the historic destination. Programming is expected to include art exhibitions, wellness retreats, food pop-ups, luxury travel excursions as well as more music events and festivals. In an official statement, the founding team at Zamna shared, “Tulum is ready to write a new tourism narrative—one that is more inclusive, cultural, and sustainable. This trust is not just a financial structure; it’s an invitation to collectively imagine the future of the destination.” View this post on InstagramA post shared by Zamna Festival (@zamna.music) To find out more about Zamna’s upcoming events, head to its website now.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "title": "The Anti-Cannes: How Sundance Became Fashion's Most Interesting Film Festival",
        "text": "The Sundance Film Festival has been at home alongside a mountain in Park City, Utah during the peak of winter for over 40 years. It differs from its contemporary film festivals for two reasons: weather and location. The two elements that dictate the way people decide to get dressed also fall into those factors. Where are you going? And what is the temperature you must prepare yourself for?Sundance, because of its cold-weather conditions, becomes an event that requires a utilitarian uniform of sorts. Think parkas, down jackets, and fur coats vs. the tuxedos and ball gowns that dominate a place like the Cannes Film Festival, which comes with its own (outdated?) dress codes. The Utah festival's less glamorous grounds make for some of the most interesting outfits on a film calendar filled with red carpets and premieres and photo calls. Eugene Hernandez, the director of Sundance, told me what makes the festival compelling when it comes to style is the \"unknown factor” of the weather. He said, “You can have a plan, and then the weather can adjust that plan which allows for some fun.”Sundance has provided a plethora of iconic looks over its 40 year run in Park City. While attending this year on behalf of Hypebeast, some festivalgoers I spoke to were reminiscing of the early ‘00s Y2K era of fits. Deja Williams, a publicist at a PR company representing key names in the film industry, told me that “the early 2000s really sells the Sundance dream” and informs how she dresses at the festival today. Some key looks she highlighted were Bob Dylan at the Masked and Anonymous premiere in 2003, Lucy Liu for Lucky Number Slevin in 2006, Chloë Sevigny, Penelope Cruz… “That decade literally carried the torch for festival fashion favorites that have gone down in history,” said Williams.You can’t talk about Sundance style without mentioning its late eponymous founder, Robert Redford, who was a menswear icon himself. With 2026 being the first festival after the passing of Redford, as well as the very last to be held in Utah, a heartfelt tribute was shown before each film screening — memorializing his valiant dedication to independent cinema. One look featured in the dedication clip that stood out to Janicza Bravo, Sundance Jury member and director of the 2020 crime comedy Zola, was Redford adorned in double denim. She explained, “The image is seared into my mind.” The perfectly fit and lived-in look was something she thought was “effortless” on Redford’s part. In our discussions about this outfit, we both agreed that Olivia Wilde and Chris Pine might have been paying homage to the Redford uniform at this year’s festival. You can see Pine tucked a denim shirt into a matching pair of jeans and held it together with a brown Western belt. Wilde channeled a similar look, but topped it off with a pair of oversized thin wired frames, eerily similar to a pair once made famous by the Sundance Kid himself. She even included an image of Robert Redford in her IG dump from the festival… I guess that confirms it?This year’s iteration of Sundance proved to be no different when it comes to sartorial moments, continuing to hold onto its legacy of being a festival littered with jackets. Having been able to finally attend the sacred grounds myself to see the action in person, I was able to gain further intel into what’s actually happening around town vs. the manicured version I’ve been fed on social media. I got to see how the actual people attending and working the festival dressed, which, in my opinion, proved to be rather fruitful. With Sundance closing up shop in Park City and moving to an equally wintry Boulder, Colorado in 2027, I think it’s safe to say that the aesthetics we associate with the festival will continue to thrive in its new home town. Below, I detail the most salient style moments I observed both online and off during Utah’s last hurrah as the capital of independent cinema. Image via @sasykmihal on InstagramCharli xcx’s The MomentWe’re officially in a post-Marty Supreme jacket world. Charli xcx’s The Moment was on everybody’s radar at the festival this year. Her presence loomed over Park City for a few days as each of the three films (The Moment, The Gallerist, and I Want Your Sex) she played acting roles in debuted back to back to back. A24 made some custom neon rave colored puffer jackets adorned with corporate spoofed The Moment logos that felt reminiscent of the OG streetwear ethos I used to read all about on this website. Stuff like Marlboro and McDonald’s logos flipped to say The Moment. The jackets were made for Charli in collaboration with her dream team just weeks before the festival — her director Aidan Zamiri, her stylist Chris Horan, and the art director/designer Sasyk. The sheer fact that a down puffer jacket was chosen as the silhouette for this statement piece hammers home the idea that this festival is all about practicality. Other movie promo merch items for The Moment that are contextual to the Sundance experience are the bright brat green beanies and scarves I saw all around town. Festival volunteers in the Kenneth Cole special issued jacketKenneth Cole’s Festival-Issued JacketsThe brand that is overwhelmingly present in the frigid Park City winter is not Arc'teryx or The North Face or Patagonia… it’s Kenneth Cole. The American designer has been a member of the Sundance Institute’s Board of Directors since 2003. He’s a staunch advocate of Robert Redford’s vision and is a dedicated supporter of the thousands of volunteers who help run the festival. For every Sundance since 2004, the brand has created over 2,500 customized jackets for the volunteer staff who have to wait out in the cold all day to assist festivalgoers traverse the grounds. Each year’s special issued jacket is different from the previous years, it’s a new design and color each time. The only design elements that stay the same are the Sundance logo and the year on the right chest and the brand’s logo on the back.Eugene Hernandez told me that Kenneth Cole himself is “very involved” in the jacket’s design that represents the festival every year. It’s unmissable, every corner on every street you will easily spot two or three people in these bright yellow to grey ombre jackets. Some of my favorite looks from Sundance involved seeing how the volunteer staff would personalize their jackets. Some got creative with the placement of their pins and others had Mr. Cole autograph their jackets with a sharpie. This year’s edition was extra special because it featured a commemorative badge on the sleeve for Robert Redford. Gregg Araki by Chase Sui Wonders, image via InstagramPerformative Performance GearIt’s obvious, but when it’s cold outside, you need a proper jacket. I just spent a few paragraphs in the intro of this article telling you exactly that. But for me, as a born and raised San Fernando Valley kid, the world of performance techwear and down jackets are absolutely alien. I come from the mecca of light outerwear, so being plopped into the middle of a ski town where at any time in the winter it could reach temperatures close to 0 degrees Fahrenheit I could not help but notice all the cold weather garments. All around Park City you can hear the swishing sounds of GORE‑TEX-laden jackets and pants. What was even more interesting was watching how festivalgoers mixed the worlds of cold performance gear with everyday wardrobes.Rafael Manuel, winner of The World Cinema Dramatic Special Jury Award for Creative Vision for Filipiñana, wore a bright red Lulelemon zip up underneath his olive colored corduroy work shirt while accepting his award. Manuel told me he comes from a warm climate and says “comfort in the cold comes beyond everything else.” He said layering is not something he gets to do often because of the climate he comes from and relishes the opportunity to do so here. I found myself relating heavily to this sentiment and found it to be very representative of the crowds I’ve observed at Sundance. The festival brings in people from all over the world, but mostly industry folk from LA who don’t get many chances to dust off their Arc’teryx Beta jackets and use them for what they’re meant for. Noé Margarito Zaragoza, Rebecca Zweig and Efraín Mojica attend the \"Jaripeo\" Premiere Image via Saria Harris on InstagramMountain ChicPossibly my least favorite Sundance style trope is what Sean Wang, director of Dìdi, calls “mountain chic.” It’s essentially dressing like a cold weather cowboy. The essentials are a bolo tie, jeans, a wide brimmed cowboy hat, with boots. I presume there could be versions of this that can be tastefully done, but in this era of ill-fitting pants (too tight) and cheaply made fast fashion I did not see any cowboy looks that were worthy of praise at my time down in Park City (on a second glance the Jaripeo team, pictured above, does look pretty cool). I guess I’m more so thinking of the some of the bad examples of this aesthetic I saw attempted all around town. It is, however, another demarcation point of Sundance in comparison to your Cannes or Venice Film Festivals. All around town you can spot many friend groups with at least one person in cowboy chic drag.The Fits of @DirectorFitsAs for my personal Sundance looks? I kept it really simple. As much as I love clothes and writing about them, I hate having to pick things out from my closet everyday. I’m always running late to things and never have the luxury of moseying around in my closet. In my time studying the sartorial habits of filmmakers, I’ve grown to really appreciate a good uniform. I’ve tried to incorporate that methodology into my own wardrobe over the years. On the grounds everyday in Park City, I wore some version of black Ben Davis Original Ben’s work pants, black Mephisto Match sneakers, a dolphin blue cropped zip up hoodie from LA Apparel, a white t-shirt underneath, with a black Barbour Transport jacket, and a bright orange Pacific Tote Company bag. Nothing crazy, always looks good, and is forever timeless. See you later, Park City. And catch you soon, Boulder.For more on Director Fits, follow him on Instagram and subscribe to his newsletter.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

        "text": "Ten C and Comoli may have cultivated the foundations of their brands in two separate continents, but their passion for crafting functional yet timeless clothing is what ties them together. In their inaugural collaboration, the two labels hone in on this shared ethos to create a limited-edition capsule collection as part of its Fall/Winter 2026 offering. Uniting on different fronts of the garment process – designs led by Comoli and produced by Ten C – the new collaboration takes shape around the Japanese brand’s sartorial design blueprint. Introducing clean-cut lines and understated volumes to everyday pieces, it proposes a hooded coat, field jacket, satin liner, crewneck and knit pants, as well as a nifty reversible two-piece that puts a new spin on the New Men’s Suit from the Italian brand’s recent collections. Meanwhile, Ten C weaves its iconic library of materials into the collection, elevating designs with a utilitarian edge. Fabric blends that can be spotted in its construction include heavyweight lambswool and Nylon Tactel as well as Nylon Crinkle – a defining material in the recently resurfaced Skye Ten Anorak. Though the collaboration comes to life with a segmented design process, the new range is an example of organic collaborative efforts, portraying a coherent vision that prioritises versatility and long-lasting durability. The new capsule collection will be available to shop later this year alongside Ten C’s wider FW26 collection. Keep up to date on its release by visiting the brand’s website or Instagram page.Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

We also post a weekly calendar of upcoming robotics events for the next few months. Please send us your events for inclusion.ICRA 2026: 1–5 June 2026, VIENNAEnjoy today’s videos! No system is immune to failure. The compromise between reducing failures and improving adaptability is a recurring problem in robotics. Modular robots exemplify this tradeoff, because the number of modules dictates both the possible functions and the odds of failure. We reverse this trend, improving reliability with an increased number of modules by exploiting redundant resources and sharing them locally.[ Science ] via [ RRL ]Now that the Atlas enterprise platform is getting to work, the research version gets one last run in the sun. Our engineers made one final push to test the limits of full-body control and mobility, with help from the RAI Institute.[ RAI ] via [ Boston Dynamics ]Announcing Isaac 0: the laundry folding robot we’re shipping to homes, starting in February 2026 in the Bay Area.[ Weave Robotics ]In a paper published in Science, researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, the Humboldt University of Berlin, and the University of Stuttgart have discovered that the secret to the elephant’s amazing sense of touch is in its unusual whiskers. The interdisciplinary team analyzed elephant trunk whiskers using advanced microscopy methods that revealed a form of material intelligence more sophisticated than the well-studied whiskers of rats and mice. This research has the potential to inspire new physically intelligent robotic sensing approaches that resemble the unusual whiskers that cover the elephant trunk.[ MPI ]Got an interest in autonomous mobile robots, ROS2, and a mere $150 lying around? Try this.[ Maker's Pet ]Thanks, Ilia!We’re giving humanoid robots swords now.[ Robotera ]A system developed by researchers at the University of Waterloo lets people collaborate with groups of robots to create works of art inspired by music.[ Waterloo ]FastUMI Pro is a multimodal, model-agnostic data acquisition system designed to power a truly end-to-end closed loop for embodied intelligence — transforming real-world data into genuine robotic capability.[ Lumos Robotics ]We usually take fingernails for granted, but they’re vital for fine-motor control and feeling textures. Our students have been doing some great work looking into the mechanics behind this.[ Paper ]This is a 550-lb all-electric coaxial unmanned rotorcraft developed by Texas A&amp;M University’s Advanced Vertical Flight Laboratory and Harmony Aeronautics as a technology demonstrator for our quiet-rotor technology. The payload capacity is 200 lb (gross weight = 750 lb). The noise level measured was around 74 dBA in hover at 50-ft making this probably the quietest rotorcraft at this scale.[ Harmony Aeronautics ]Harvard scientists have created an advanced 3D printing method for developing soft robotics. This technique, called rotational multimaterial 3D printing, enables the fabrication of complex shapes and tubular structures with dissolvable internal channels. This innovation could someday accelerate the production of components for surgical robotics and assistive devices, advancing medical technology.[ Harvard ]Lynx M20 wheeled-legged robot steps onto the ice and snow, taking on challenges inspired by four winter sports scenarios. Who says robots can’t enjoy winter sports?[ Deep Robotics ]NGL right now I find this more satisfying to watch than a humanoid doing just about anything.[ Fanuc ]At Mentee Robotics, we design and build humanoid robots from the ground up with one goal: reliable, scalable deployment in real-world industrial environments. Our robots are powered by deep vertical integration across hardware, embedded software, and AI, all developed in-house to close the Sim2Real gap and enable continuous, around-the-clock operation.[ Mentee Robotics ]You don’t need to watch this whole video, but the idea of little submarines that hitch rides on bigger boats and recharge themselves is kind of cool.[ Lockheed Martin ]Learn about the work of Dr. Roland Siegwart, Dr. Anibal Ollero, Dr. Dario Floreano, and Dr. Margarita Chli on flying robots and some of the challenges they are still trying to tackle in this video created based on their presentations at ICRA@40 the 40th anniversary celebration of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation.[ ICRA@40 ]",

The production of beneficial metabolites decreases, while microbes capable of provoking a constant inflammatory reaction increase in number. Studies of fecal microbiota transplantation have demonstrated that the unfavorable composition of the gut microbiome in old animals can be rejuvenated via the introduction of donor material from young animals. One treatment produces lasting rejuvenation, though presumably the processes of aging will slowly degrade the gut microbiome over time, just as they did before. Health is improved and life span increased. Fecal microbiota transplantation sees enough use in medicine for researchers and clinicians to broadly understand the safety profile [&#8230;]",

        "text": "The supporting cells of the brain are collectively known as glia. This category includes astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, among others, cells that are responsible for maintenance of an environment in which neurons can function, or directly aiding neuron function in various ways. Researchers here discuss how age-related changes in the interactions between neurons and glia may both arise from neurodegeneration and drive neurodegeneration. Manipulating some of these interactions can slow aging and extend life span in flies. Aging is often discussed as something that happens inside cells: DNA is damaged, mitochondria stop working, and proteins are misfolded. But aging also changes how cells communicate with each other. For example, neurons in the brain rely on neighboring cells, called glia, for nutrients, waste handling, and local [&#8230;]",
